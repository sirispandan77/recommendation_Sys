My best idea, and where I use it now, is attached to the arm of my executive style office chair, near where it meets the chair back.  I don't knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.  It is really a nifty place to stow the headphones--within easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either.<br /><br />It is well-constructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.

Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""Xquare 2\\"". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That's quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds, but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it's a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren't trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there's the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at, but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here, especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""reference\\"" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician, you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn't one, and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears, I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods, which \\""sit\\"" in my ears nicely, don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small.

What a great deal, this bluetooth speaker is LOUD! It's got fair bass levels for the size and price point. Both front and back of the device emit sound, though front is louder. I think this gives it better quality and more range. I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars, when pressing the volume +/- the music stops for a &#34;boop&#34; noise. Also, when powering on, changing modes, or pairing a device, the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical. It's a little goofy, but at this price point who cares.

I connected my wired network and started to play around.  The sound quality is excellent!  The choices of inputs are excellent as well.  The one great shortcoming is the display panel.  I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980's technology into this otherwise modern, high quality system.  It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages, such as track name, station id etc.  beyond me why they cut this corner.<br /><br />What saves the day is the app.  Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device.

I did however get them to sound great with the use of the PowerAmp App on my phone, but for the most part, it is honest difficult to find a good spot with the equalizer and if using it with a device that has no PowerAmp app, it will continue to sound boomy. the highs and upper mids are much quieter in comparison. the ear hooks in my opinion are uncomfortable. I really wanted to like these headphones, but they were just too &#34;high Maintenance&#34;. I felt like I was working too hard to be happy with them, I want something that sounds and works good out of the box. the customer buys and uses, they don't work to make the product meet their expectations. for these reasons I decided to return and Went with the Jaybirds Bluebuds x. They are more Portable, come with a hardshell case in comparison to the cheap mesh bag included with the photives, feature better battery life, sound better, and are far more comfortable.

I've ordered 3 pairs - the first one lasted a while but inevitably broke after years of good service.<br /><br />So, I ordered a second pair. No bueno. It literally went bad on the 2nd listen!!

Basically, only one of the headphones receives sound - regardless of what the headphones are plugged into. No matter if it's a computer, a phone or something else - only the headphone opposite of the mic works - which is quite inconvenient.<br /><br />To make matters worse - half the time the sound quality of the working headphone is horrendous.

But has a downfall.,"Here’s the quickie...<br /><br />1. Cool LCD screen that shows the status of all the batteries.<br />2. 4 cell charging is done with a time-share system where only 2 batteries are actually being charged at the same time.<br />3. It can charge LiFePO4!<br />4. Cooling is a bit of a problem (for in depth, read the whole review)<br />5. Overall this is a charger with a good warranty. If you got a flashlight or ecig that goes through batteries like a mad man, this is a good candidate.<br /><br />Full review:<br /><br />The looks:<br /><br />The Nitecore D4's outer appearance is quite amazing. The curves tapers off the edges leaving the charger with an elegant look and feel, not that you will be holding the D4 like a phone watching the bars slowly move up. Since when it is fully populated with 3400mah Panasonic 18650's this D4 becomes a brick, a charging brick?<br /><br />The usage:<br /><br />The D4 can charge pretty much any battery you can find, with the exception of the 9v. (I wish Nitecore made a 9v battery adapter...) For the lithium groups, you can either have it cut off at 4.20v for Lithium ions/IMR. Or if you have LiFePO4's you can have it cut off at 3.60v. The charger can't automatically detect a LiFePO4 from a Lion battery, but all you need to do is hold the mode button until it switches over to LiFePO4. FYI, Holding the MODE button also puts it into &quot;Low&quot; speed charging, but keep holding it and it will switch over it LiFe. For NiMH and NiCD batteries, the D4 uses delta Voltage and delta Time (-dV/dt on the LCD), the D4 measures the change in voltage over the change in time to detect when the battery is full.<br /><br />**********Charging 101**********<br /><br />Lithium batteries:<br /><br />When charging a lithium battery, you use a constant current (CC) to bring the cell to a voltage of 3.6v/4.2v/4.35v. When the max voltage is reached, the processor of the D4 will switch over to constant voltage (CV) and it will wait until the current drops below a certain amount. When that current is reached, the D4 cuts the power supply and it will show the &quot;Charging Finished&quot; icon. On this particular charger, it doesn't do a continued float charging where it keeps the batteries topped off. So that means if you leave the charger plugged in and powered, after 1 year the battery voltage will be lower than the charge voltage, but the charger will still say &quot;Charging Finished&quot;. The same goes for all &quot;common&quot; Lithium batteries in all shapes and sizes. Notice I wrote &quot;common&quot;, so no charging Lithium-Air or Lithium perchlorate batteries in the D4…<br /><br />Just FYI, Lithium batteries when over discharged will be damaged, because the cathode and anode of the battery will be destroyed and cannot be reverted back to its original state, thus losing capacity on a massive scale. Over charging Lithium batteries can be catastrophic, because the cell will heat up and go into thermal runaway. (When the battery self-destructs, like a diesel engine burning motor oil, runaway diesel). It’s quite fascinating how lithium batteries symbolize our own DNA. Every time they get charged, their “ends” are damaged a little bit losing capacity just like how our DNA loses its telomeres every time it replicate.<br /><br />For NiMH/NiCD batteries:<br /><br />The D4 uses a –Delta Voltage over Delta Time, or in English, the change in voltage over the change in time. So when the D4 receives a dead Eneloop AA for example, it will begin to supply power and take down notes of the time. It will also start a virtual graph with slopes, plotting down many voltage measurements along the time axis. So now you have a timer, memory, and a virtual graph. Seem quite complex just to charge a battery right? Without going too deep into the charging algorithm, let me finish off this off. When the processor detects a sudden drop of voltage at the terminals, the charger will terminate the charge and call it complete. Becauseof the close relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary.<br /><br />**********END CHARGING 101**********<br /><br />The bads about the D4:<br /><br />The thermal design of this charger is horrific. Despite the time-share charging system, it still uses mosfets with close to none heat sinking. I had to make custom copper heat sinks and fill the whole charger with thermal pads. Although we are at a state in tech where even at 100C these PN junctions still operate happily for a while. But for long-term durability, the heat created is never good. I can safely say that the charger will last a good year or two, but with that amount of heat produced, you can question the efficiency of this charger. Granted, it only uses 12v 1amp, 12 watts, but it is only charging at 1400ma (750ma x2) @ 4.2v.<br /><br />Bottom-line is this charger is a must have, if you have Skyray kings or Supfire m6’s. Even their own TM06 uses 4x 18650s. I have had this charger for almost a month already. Gave me no problems, I have charged all my Eneloops and my whole collection of unprotected 18650’s, 32 of them!<br /><br />I this was a review that I wish everyone could write. I paid for the charger out of pocket, and I love it.e relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary.<br /><br />**********END CHARGING 101**********<br /><br />The bads about the D4:<br /><br />The thermal design of this charger is horrific.

The product photo shows a series of tiny vertical relief cuts around the outer conductor of the MCX male connector that provides a kind of springiness that allows the male connector to flex slightly and then grab onto the internal components of the MCX female connector. Well, my pigtail was manufactured without those relief cuts. No amount of pressure will allow the male connector to be inserted in my NooElec RTL-SDR dongle, because there is no flex whatsoever. Needless to say, I am disappointed. Every photo of a MCX male plug that I've found online shows those relief cuts, so I assume they're part of the spec and this was just a massive screw-up by quality control. Maybe other people's MCX female ports have more flex to make up for it, but the plastic case of my RTL-SDR dongle won't even allow the rim of the male connector to pass.

I have always loved the portability and bass of my skull candy earbuds when you get a good seal but I have trouble getting the right fit. with the rubber tips it seems like the only way to get them to not fall out, while also getting good bass is too jam them into your ear pretty good and at that point, you have pushed out all the air and can feel almost like a suction that is putting tension of your eardrum. Not with these! I read about these while looking at the reviews for the Jaybirds Blue Buds X, I ended up ordering them along with a set of these, I can't tell you how happy I am with the setup. I don't even use the little wing tips or whatever you want to call them. roll these just like a normal foam earplug, and quickly place in a comfortable spot in your ear, hold for around 5-10 seconds and listen to your music. The highs are good and mids are good, and with the perfect seal you get with these foam ear tips, you get great heavy bass. but it is CLEAN. its not muddy, exaggerated, it is very present but in the cleanest way possible. Get the right fit and then head bang for an hour and I would be surprised if you managed to get them to fall out.",2015-08-31

Aiming directly at the towers, I got 0% signal, even without combining the antennas, mounting this directly on my mast.<br /><br />Customer support at Antennas Direct says the range is good for 35 miles MAX. If they had written that on the product description instead of the confusing &#34;25-50+ miles&#34;, I probably wouldn't have spent my whole afternoon on the roof.<br /><br />This is a great solution if you're looking to add short range VHF to your signal downlead.

Bought at Costco and am amazed at this bargain. No nonsense loud voices telling if you're connected or not (finally!!) and the sound is outstanding considering the size of this item. I use it mainly in my car to listen to lectures and occasionally some music too. One thing that could be improved is the loudness although as is it fits the bill quite well. Where this thing impressed me the most though, is with its outstanding speakerphone capability. Not one complain yet from anyone I've spoken to through this little gizmo and that for me was a real deciding factor as tons of little BT speakers have as loud or louder a sound, long lasting battery, yadi yada...but their speakerphone in general mostly stink at best...this guy however pulls it off nearly as well as my way more expensive Sony SRS X3!!<br />Cool design and colors BTW. Battery lasts quite many hours. Have not timed it but 6-7 hours minimum I'd say.<br />Charges pretty fast too.<br />READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! Most reviewers are complaining about loosing the BT connection settings after turning it off. Some even mention the ridiculously long time it takes to shut it down lol.<br />Once paired if you click the on/off button just once for a short second OR LESS the speaker will alternate between the on and off mode and go in standby mode. If you hold the button for a few seconds then a complete shutdown happens and therefore the connection settings may be lost. This in fact is a very welcome and refreshing function (like my Sony SRS X3) as holding the button down for a stupid amount of time is what's required on most low to mid end BT speakers and I personally can't stand it. It's unnecessary and annoying. This one, one quick click it's off, one quick click and it's on... And remember, NO annoying voices either....I love that! Essentially a very well engineered piece of electronics. Btw it does mentioned being engineers in the USA and made in China. I'm not surprised by the results especially the speakerphone function (can't stress its usefulness enough).<br />Anyways, read the instructions and enjoy this remarkable and recommendable BT speaker.<br />I'm probably gonna purchase a couple more for the price they sell.<br />I absolutely and easily recommend this item.",2015-08-31

It comes in an attractive box, which includes a manual in several languages, a USB charger cable, an audio cable, but no charger. You have to use the USB charger included with your phone, tablet or use the one on your computer.<br />The speaker comes with a built-in rechargeable battery. It is not clear whether the battery can be replaced - perhaps by unscrewing the cover on the speaker. There is no indicator on the speaker of how much battery life is left. But an interesting feature is that next to the bluetooth icon on my iPhone/iPad there is a battery charge level indicator for the speaker. Advertised play time is pretty long but I did not verify.<br /><br />The speaker uses the newer Bluetooth 4 standard. Volume changes on device and speaker are in sync, which is a lot more convenient. However, the volume buttons do not have a second function to skip forward/backward like they have on<br />Taotronics other models.<br /><br />You can pair more than one Bluetooth device with the speakers. However, the manual does not list how many devices can be paired with speaker.<br /><br />The bluetooth range is great and covers at least 30ft plus. Keep in mind that this is a Mono speaker. I would not call this speaker bidirectional since most of the sound is coming out the front. I believe the Bass is supposed to come out of the back Sound is a bit thin but quite acceptable for a speaker of this size and prize, and definitely loud enough across the room.<br /><br />The speaker has a microphone and can therefore be used as a speaker phone. The speaker plays the ring tone of your phone. A conversation on the phone was loud and clear and the microphone worked fine.<br /><br />The speaker can be put on a flat surface, has a large rubber handle and a tripod screw underneath. The rubberized covering looks strong and sturdy. I did not test how waterproof the speaker is.<br /><br />Overall a great outdoor speaker, great packaging, easy to read manual with clear contact information. A suggestion would be to include a travel pouch since you may want to throw this speaker in a beach bag or hiking backpack.",2015-08-31

Now, some people may have an older receiver that would have a feature to synthesize surround for a 5.1 system but usually, if you have that feature available to you, then one would &#34;tend to&#34; also have HDMI inputs on their receiver.  If you have HDMI inputs on your audio receiver... why bother?  This is a work around for those who don't.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs, the high likelihood is that you don't need this.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs and you aren't getting audio output 1. Check your settings and the sequence in which you turn components on  (I find that turning on my plasma TV before turning on my receiver works better).  2.  You might need to find an HDMI cable that specifies it has &#34;audio return&#34;.  All that being said, if you need this kind of workaround solution to deliver an analog feed an older sound system, then  ---&#62; running your Blu-Ray player's sound output through a decent stereo's analog inputs using this interface conversion box beats the pants off using the the wimpy speakers in most TVs.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Caveat 2:  OREI DOES ** NOT ** GIVE YOU A NON-OPTICAL (i.e. copper wire) CABLE ...which I believe will be the solution most people actually want.  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ONE SEPARATELY.  I strongly recommend buying a specifically &#34;Digital&#34; cable, labeled as being meant for SPDIF (Sony/Panasonic Digital Interface) like in the link I mentioned above - they run 5 - 10 dollars.  If you try using a conventional RCA analog audio cable the digital signal may corrupt or the sound could stutter, especially over longer cable lengths.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Caveat 3:  I suppose there may be some Blu-Ray players out there that, for cost cutting purposes, have omitted the SPDIF connector that looks like a single RCA jack.  In which case this product would not be a solution you could use.  Final note:  This unit also comes with an optical connector interface and a probably 3 ft optical cable.  I did not use that feature or test it so cannot speak to how well it works.  You * could * run the blu-ray player's HDMI cable to your flat screen and then, IF it had an optical out, use the supplied optical cable to this OREI box and then run RCA analog cables to your stereo.  The big unknown is:  Will the audio output &#34;lag&#34; or stay in sync with your TV?  Sometimes you can set video / sound delay in your TV.  You'd just have to test.  Again, if your receiver has HDMI built in, there is usually no need to use this kind of product.",2015-08-31

I had purchased it for use in a hifi system along with a Wharfedale 8&#34; subwoofer.  I had read good things, but I was still surprised by the quality of this cable when it arrived.  I also use BlueRigger HDMI cables, and I am very happy with those, so I bought this as well.  It is a very thick, dual shielded cable, and the ends are gold plated and fit snugly with no play.  It was exactly what I needed.  Bass was crisp and clear, no hum or interference.  I ended up replacing this with a MediaBridge cable because I discovered that if I used a cable with a split mono lead, I could get a bit more input level and a noticeable gain in output.  I wish that BlueRigger made a split mono version.  I briefly considered buying a small splitter adapter and a second one of these because of how nice it is, but the cost would have been too high.  If your subwoofer uses a crossover that only requires a single RCA connection, then this is the cable to get.  If you can get a bit more level using a splitter, or a split mono cable, then go that route because there is a noticeable difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Thick, high quality cable<br />-Gold plated ends<br />-Snug fitting<br />-No hum or interference (dual shielded)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not offered in a split mono version<br /><br />All in all, I will be using more BlueRigger products in the future and I look forward to seeing their line expand.

Though, it seemed like I would have to sacrifice one or the other, I was going to get an unlocked smart phone until I came across this guy. It's not perfect, however, I rate it 5 stars for what you get for $100. Don't be fooled either, It is an amazing player that I believe is more favorable over an iPod Classic and other expensive Hi-Res Players.<br />At first glance, It looks like a knock-off of a smaller version of an iPod Classic which greets you with an expeditious boot-up and on to the main screen that will throw you off a bit. It's easy to navigate using the mechanical jog wheel which feels sturdy and has minimal leeway. The settings are simple to understand and has tech manual included if you decide you need to use it after you've thrown it out. The chassis feels solid even with the plastic back panel and comes with a silicone case too if you're feeling skeptical. The battery is long lasting (approximately 11 hours) and has a micro USB jack to charge it.<br />There are two types of ways to view your music: File Mode and Category Mode. In File Mode, It will appear exactly how you arrange your files or music on your removable drive window on your computer which allows users to customize and organize their music listings, for example, I sorted my music by Artist &#62; Album &#62; Songs. This will require some time and can be fixed by updating your files in settings which will automatically designate your music based on the files' detailed information under Category Mode. The only drawback to Category Mode, which I believe is the only major drawback, is that you can only store 5800 songs in Category Mode yet you can have as many songs as your MicroSD card can fit under File Mode.<br />Some of the user interface abilities could have been improved but unfortunately, Fiio has stopped making updates for the X1 and will soon be replaced by the X3 Next Generation. All in all, this player has exceeded my expectation and I will try out some lose-less music to see the true potential of the X1.",2015-08-31

Definitely a great upgrade if you want something that looks or feels different from the stock cable or need a replacement cable.,2015-08-31

I purchased the product to experiment and provide that detail in one review. Overall this product DID bring out additional detail when viewed up close, it was just not noticeable from the location where we watch the TV in 2D or 3D. This is why I have given it an &#34;OK&#34; rating. We sit approximately 11 feet away from the TV in a completely dark room directly in front of the TV (No angle). I didn't really notice any difference until I was 2 feet away from the front of the TV.  The unit has a test mode where one half of the picture has been clarified and the other half has not, for your comparison. We primarily watch movies in Blu-ray or up-converted DVD's and all my equipment is Samsung. (TV has been setup to provide optimum color and clarity. (Not setup with factory default settings). TV Model Number: PN64D550C1F. Blu-ray player Model number is HT-D550). I also tried it on our cable input to see if that made much of a difference. It did not. Again, from our viewing position, we sit too far away for it to provide any noticeable improvement in clarity.<br />To sum up, it works as defined but really did not provide us with a better viewing experience for the size and type of TV based on the viewing distance we watch from. This unit is somewhat expensive and I would not recommend its purchase for TV's of my size and type or smaller.  I think it is really designed for very large screen projector style TV's.",2015-08-31

It's a tough choice.,"[[ASIN:B003EM800S Panasonic RPHJE120S In-Ear Headphone, Silver]]<br /><br />I have been using these Panasonics for over a year now.  For me, they are still the biggest bang for the buck.  I thought I lost my last pair so I decided to &#34;splurge&#34; and pay twice the price for these SoundMAGICs as I heard great things.  There are reviews that specifically compares my Panasonics to the ES18s where great majority states that ES18s are the clear winner.<br /><br />For me, however, it isn't all that clear.  Perhaps from sound quality alone that may be the case but the nominal gains you get in sound quality can be negated by some of the other factors that I considered.<br /><br />I found my set of Panasonics after I received the ES18 which allowed me to conduct a side by side comparison. Some notes about the comparison:<br />- I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate a good set of headphones.  Let's just say that I'm willing to pay up to $20 for a good set.<br />- Used the ES18 for a few days before comparing to allow burn in period (~60 hrs).<br />- Same music and videos were used on iPad Mini and iPhone 5.  I switched the two earphones back and forth between the two devices to make sure that there wasn't a sound difference from device source.  There wasn't.  I had one set in one ear and the other set in other ear at the same time (but this actually made it harder to tell the difference between the two).<br /><br />What I found in order of personal importance:<br /><br />Sound quality winner: SoundMAGIC ES18<br />Both delivers good bass for such affordable sets.  Online sources say the ES18's bass is superior.  I couldn't tell and must call that a draw.  The lowest lows from both sets seemed near equal.  Both had that headbobbing thump that makes listening to them enjoyable.  Where the ES18 wins is the mid's.  My slight criticism of the Panasonics is that the mid's do seem a bit flat making the ES18 seem more balanced.  I can also hear more detail in the ES18.  And because the more balanced approach, voice clarity is better on the ES18 also.  At first I thought that the Panasonics had better bass but it's because it seems to &#34;push&#34; the lows (making the lower range louder) but in reality the absolute lows of both sets were fairly, and near equally, deep.  Some may prefer the Panasonic's over-emphasis on the low end.  So the ES18 has better sound because of the balance, more mid, overall detail and voice clarity.  How much more did I enjoy the ES18 in terms of sound quality?  In a completely subjective term: a little.  Yes, there is a clear difference on HOW they sound but it took me a couple hours of going back and forth to ultimately say I ENJOY the sound of ES18 more.<br /><br />Comfort and design winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120<br />This one was absolutely clear to me as soon as I put on the ES18.  The Panasonic's &#34;Ergo-fit&#34; design has the offset ear insert and a flat surface to lay in the flat spot next to the ear hole.  Not only does the Ergo-fit design make it more comfy, it allows a more secure fit.  The ear insert itself on the Panasonics is smaller probably due to the smaller driver size (9mm vs. 10mm).  While neither are heavy, you can tell the weight of the ES18 is higher (again, probably due to the larger driver size).  Also, the Panasonic's shape doesn't protrude out of the ear as much as the ES18.  You could almost side sleep with the Panasonics on.<br /><br />Other design consideration is the discerning between the left and and the right insert.  The Panasonic's design is distinct to which ear insert belongs to which side of the ear (due to the flat surface as part of the Ergo-fit design).  You'll be able to understand and see from a distance which insert belongs to which ear within seconds of ownership.  The ES18, on the other hand, is symmetric in design.  There is a tiny little &#34;R&#34; at the cord stem for the right side but it's impossible to see in low lighting.  I now go by the &#34;ES18&#34; written on the right insert.  The left side does not have a &#34;L&#34; but I know now that the left insert has SoundMAGIC's insignia on that side.  The point is, you can tell the left and right on the Panny's easily but you'll have see up close to discern on the ES18.<br /><br />Cord material winner:  SoundMAGIC ES18<br />Another no brainer.  The Panny's thin cord allows it to get tangled easily.  I like the heft that the ES18's cord has that resist tangling.  I'm spending anywhere between 10 seconds to a minute untangling or unknotting the Panny's cord everytime I take it out of my gym bag.  Haven't done once with ES18.  While this may not seem like a big deal, I've had more &#34;Not again!&#34; moments when I took the Panasonics out of my bag than I'd care for.<br /><br />Cost winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120<br />At around six bucks, less than half price of the ES18.<br /><br />To say which I like more is tough to answer when you factor in cost and comfort.  I give both 5 stars.  Yes I do think the ES18 sounds better but I still quite enjoy the Panasonic's sound.  What you get for the money on either is extraordinary.  Those that appreciate a balanced approach and have a more critical ear should look into the ES18.  Those that just want something better than the cruddy stock earbuds that came with your mobile device can't go wrong with the $6 Panasonics.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/1/15:<br />There is an L indicating the left ear piece.  I missed that initially.  Just proves how hard it is to see the L and R indicators.  I placed a little strip of red tape on the right ear piece so I can easily tell the difference.<br /><br />I find myself reaching for the ES18 over the Panasonics when side-by-side as I do enjoy the sound of these more when I want to rock out. The bass has a better impact as you can hear both the sub-bass and mid-bass while the Panny's bass seem blended together.  The sound stage is another significant difference where the ES18 sound much more open.  The Panny's sound like listening to loud speakers in a small enclosed room compared to these.  There's so much debate in the online universe about which value IEMs have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18's do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.  Man, I'm still dizzy from trying to decipher online what is the best value IEM.  There's so many out there in the $5-$25 range that's rated well.  I guess that's a win for us value consumers.  The biggest concensus knock against the ES18 I found online is that the treble is rolled off and lacks the sizzle that some prefer.  I'm ok with it as I don't want anything piercing.<br /><br />My biggest personal gripe is that the bass is nonexistent at moderate to low volume so I do prefer the Panny's when I'm in a mellow mood.  The Panny's still have a good thump at lower volumes.  The ES18's bass presence is hugely dependent on volume and without that presence, it completely lacks depth.  I didn't see many complaints about this online so I'm wondering if it's an issue with my set or am I the only one who cares?  I'm going to assume the latter as the set works just fine otherwise.  And because of the bass-volume dependency, the ES18's lose versatility.  I'm one of those that listen to all kinds of music so the lack of versatility is somewhat disappointing.  I'm glad to have both in the end.  I'll probably use these 4 of 5 times and use the Panny's for the remainder for sit down listening.  It's Panny's all the way for working out due to the more comfortable and secure fit.<br /><br />Added note:  I'm now a proud owner of the Panasonic TCM125's (down to $9 here on Amazon!), the RPHJE120 equivalent with mic and remote.  Gave the 120's to the GF who lost her stock buds.  Now I can answer calls during workout without having to pull phone out of pocket.  Some say the 125's soundbetter and some say the 120's sound better (CNET says latter).  I went back and forth after burning in the 125's.  I cannot tell a difference.  To me it's the same darn thing; it's just a matter of paying extra $3 to get the mic/remote.<br /><br />One thing I will say is that both Panny's can get much louder than the ES18.  It may be a matter of impedence and/or sensitivity.  I think the highest volume for the ES18 will be more than enough for the average listener but not for those that want it super loud.s have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18's do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.

However the audio will cut out here and there very so often.For under $15 the pair is ok for music. I do not recommend it for more than that price and I do not recommend it for video playback as the cheaper chipset inside loses slight connection even in clear line of sight to the bluetooth source and your video goes out of audio sync and that ruins it as a video playback bluetooth headset. Its mostly made of cheaply put together plastic so durability is not the greatest but its good enough if you take care and caution when putting then back in your backpack or purse etc. The fit is good and they say put for the most part, even though the wing tips that come with them are pretty much useless as they do not give a tight secure fit like many of the other more expensive bluetooth headsets do. I do not think they will be very sweat resistant so if you are a heavy sweater you may want to look elsewhere. However I cannot say for sure bc I do not not sweat a lot and even though its a cheap plastic build they do have the slightest of separation from your ear in that its hard to get actual drops of sweat on them unless you have longer hair and its wet or again are a real heavy sweater or runner etc.<br /><br />There are many generic branded versions of this headset (Mpow, iclever etc) and some are a little better with a better chipset and have aptx certification (supposedly, and its supposedly supposed to be better more CD like quality sound) so the filesonic version of this headset is the cheaper version but it sounds good enough for everyday or gym use.

I decided to upgrade because I wanted a receiver that does Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and also has HDMI 2.0a: and HDCP 2.2 support.  There have been many improvements over the last five years which have been incorporated into the receiver.  (Too many to mention.)  It plays louder, has a smoother, more balanced sound, and seems to run cooler than my old unit.  It took about thirty minutes to get everything set up including a basic calibration.  ( I'm coming from a previous Yamaha receiver so I knew what to expect, but the quick set-up guide makes it pretty simple to get started for people not used to the Yamaha brand.)  Forgot to add :  The standard antennae-connected radio works great.  (Something my previous Yamaha 2000 did poorly.)  The Internet radio is also performing superbly.",2015-08-31

Let me make one thing clear, the quality of this headphone can be replicated by cheaper headphones, BUT... not if you amp them. I went 2 months without an amp and they were great, dug real low on movies with bass and, well there are other reviews about the awesome sound but frankly it's a flat EQ (which was done on purpose and is a good thing) but I bought them for their bass capabilities not for their ability to replicate audio without 'tarnishing' it. I used a Fiio E17k and these things WOKE UP. You can adjust the bass, treble, and whatnot to remain flat and even then these things sound better. Add +4 or +6 to the bass EQ though and these are FUN.<br />  Some people mention that when you get high end headphones like these and an amp it just makes bad music stick out more, it is unfortunately very true. I can immediately tell which tracks on my ipod or on Youtube were downloaded at low quality, it's painful to listen to... but it's completely worth it when you find good HQ tracks because these babies put you in the studio. Bass guitars have concert like depth, highs are not shrill, the amp completely brings back the mids that some people have complained about not being up to par, and if you throw on techno/trap/rap ... if you're into that sort of thing... the D600s are thrilling. ss...<br />  Long story short, these are great by themselves, but if you want to actually experience them the way they are meant to be experienced, and have some hard hitting (not distorted or overbearing) bass- GET THEM with an AMP!!!!<br />Sidenote, I almost didn't buy these because of a negative review about the headband being uncomfortable, but I have a buzzcut, a normal sized/shaped head ( I think ) and I have these on for hours at a time with no trouble. They are in fact extremely comfortable and I've never had to take them off out of annoyance.",2015-08-31

It wasn't new, but it was new to me.  Until then, I wasn't really sure what all of the whole HDMI thing was about.  It just looks like a fatter USB plug if you don't have HDMI.  Imagine my surprise when my older electronics also needed to be replaced with newer ones and they all required or suggested an HDMI connection.  That's great, if your TV has more than one HDMI port!<br /><br />My older TV works beautifully, so I couldn't justify buying another TV just to get more HDMI ports.

I decided on the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out (Hdmi V1.3) Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.<br /><br />I was nervous about setting this up, but it was easy and fast.  It literally took about 2 minutes from the time I took it out of the package until I was watching TV using the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.  I plugged my Apple TV into the adapter and the adapter into the back of my TV.  I switched the TV and Apple TV back on but the Apple TV didn't switch on.  I moved the Apple TV to the second port on the adapter and it was fully functional.<br /><br />The picture quality is as good as it was when I had the Apple TV connected directly to the TV.

To tighten, I used a pair of wire clippers and a flat head screwdriver. Manually tighten the tie until you can't tighten any more. Clamp the wire clippers on the extra length of tie near the ball bearing housing. Take your flat head, rest against the wire clippers, and gently push the ball bearing housing further up the tie.

Frankly put, Internet radio is where radio is today. Not only do many commercial stations have an Internet feed, but many Internet only stations exist some of which are commercial free.<br /><br />For us, the chief joy of this device over the old tech which only receives local signals is that we can get stations from all over the world. This allows us to listen to shows we could never expect to get locally plus we listen Internationally. Those guys in Zimbabwe really rock out. Once you try this, you'll see how limited regular radio - even subscriber radio such as Sirius - is.<br /><br />Let me say this: if you think the news is reflected by the US outlets such as CNN, Fox, MSHAHA or whatever, you are missing a lot.<br /><br />This is a huge heavy device with a relatively small non-touch screen. Setup isn't difficult except make sure your ISP opens Port 80 before you start. This is usually closed by default. Once online, you register your unit with Grace and you're off and running.<br /><br />The sound is decent if not great. There is a built in equalizer if you want to make your own output bias so the complaints here about lack of bass are, to me, baseless. Boost the bass if you want.<br /><br />We have ours hooked to a pair of JBL speakers through a homemade little 20w amp which makes the sound quite nice. You can get such amps for less than $20 from all the usual suspects.<br /><br />The device comes complete to hook into a few services notably Pandora. Browsing through the huge selections of Internet stations is daunting using the radio itself. This is made much easier using the iOS or Android (Windows phones don't apply) app available for free at the usual outlets.<br /><br />We use iOS here and found the app to be sluggish and annoying on two iPhone 6's but quite useful on iPads G3 and G5. Programming presets and browsing the Internet is so much easier using the app that I doubt one would much enjoy this device having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio. The remote works well but is limited to LOS being infrared.<br /><br />I'd really like to have seen a larger screen located on top of the unit which is touch capable and the addition of Bluetooth. It does have a headphone output but wired only. Yes, I can get a Bluetooth adapter to fit the 3.5 mm headphone jack but today Bluetooth is pretty common.<br /><br />Overall we're highly pleased with our purchase and would surely do it again.vice having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio.

US,41645225,RWC9JUOZCEX6W,B000023VW2,333653448,Sangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antenna,Electronics,5,4,4,N,N,"A handy, portable random wire antenna","The Sangean ANT-60 antenna is good for what it is and performs as it should. One came packed with my excellent Sangean ATS-909X multiband radio. What is it? ANT-60 is a 23' random wire antenna that reels into a spool like a measuring tape. That makes it easy to pack and carry around. It has a 3.5mm plug that fits into the external antenna socket on many portable shortwave radios. This plug is the same as a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug available as an electronics part from electronics stores like Radio Shack. The ANT-60 includes an alligator clip adaptor that allows the user to connect the ANT-60 center plug pin to the whip antenna of radios that do not feature an external 3.5mm-1/8&#34;antenna jack. ANT-60 also includes a strap and clip for hanging the far end of the antenna. ANT-60 is nice as a portable antenna for temporary setups. I pack mine when traveling or when using the radio on the boat.  A random wire antenna will provide useful signal gain over a built-in telescopic whip SW antenna if the wire is long enough for the frequency to be received. The ANT-60 is long enough to provide excellent gain for SW frequencies over 12.0 MHz. For frequencies lower than that don't expect quite as much gain. For an example from my location nnear the US west coast, Radio Australia at 17.840 MHz late afternoons and evenings comes in two or three times stronger with ANT-60 compared to using the built-in whip antenna on the Sangean ATS-909X. But, listening to Radio Havana Cuba during the evening at the lower frequency of 6.100 MHz may only be 50% to two times stronger with ANT-60 compared to the whip antenna. The ANT-60 doesn't do quite as well at lower frequencies due to it's relatively short length. The built-in ferrite bar antennas found on most multi-band portables will do a better job for AM band (MW) radio which is much lower in frequency than SW. ANT-60 works best with SW.   The ANT-60 antenna should be hung horizontally and as high off the ground as convenient. Six to eightfeet off the ground will do fine. The direction isn't that critical at this low height off the ground. No need to string it up tightly, a little sag in the wire won't hurt. Random wire antennas work best if you use them outdoors. They can work well inside wooden framed houses. You can also use a random wire antenna indoors by running most of the wire outdoors through a window or doorway.  ANT-60 may be purchased for under $15 and sometimes for under $10. Keep in mind that for $25 you can buy 75' or more of 18 gauge insulated copper wire, a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug and some mounting hardware and have a permanent random wire antenna that will run circles around the ANT-60 at all SW frequencies down to 3.0 MHz and maybe below that. I use a 120' random wire at home mounted eight feet off the ground. That antenna rocks.  Keep in mind that quite a few user/reviewers and blog reviewers of short wave gear do not understand shortwave radio very well. SW reception is always better with outdoor antennas. Areas located in &#34;the boonies&#34; often offer the best reception of all because they are located away from electronic devices that cause RFI (radio frequency interference) with shortwave receivers. Those new to shortwave may also not understand that certain times of day offer better shortwave reception than others and that most shortwave bands work better at certain times of day than others. Inexpensive portable shortwave radios priced under $150 are likely to offer performance that is limited, at best. Cheap radios often rely too much on amplified antenna gain from a whip antenna and may overload if a longer external antenna like ANT-60 is attached.  For well-designed shortwave radios (portable or tabletop) the ANT-60 will work better than a built-in whip antenna. The reel-up feature is a nice convenience.",2015-08-31

This is my third Onkyo receiver.

What are you waiting for?,"Just as the title states, this is an awesome wireless speaker! This product is tinier than expected and measures 2.5&#34; wide by 2&#34; tall. Here are the features this speaker can do below. This product also contains a charging/Line-in cord and a handy little velvet bag for safe traveling.<br /><br />* Bluetooth pairing to listen to music (Both Pandora and Spotify worked flawless for me, as well as music downloaded onto my phone)<br />* Hands Free calling via Bluetooth<br />* Play music via the microSD card (Supports up to 64GB)<br />* FM Tuner (Another feature that worked perfect for me)<br />* Music via Line-in mode<br />* NFC pairing (Didn't work for me, see below)<br /><br />These are a ton of features that are available for this speaker. Everything worked well beyond my expectation minus the NFC pairing. For some reason, I couldn't pair my phone to the speaker using NFC. It could have been the phone case I'm using, but I didn't make too much effort to try and get it working. I prefer bluetooth over NFC anyways, so this wasn't a big deal. I'm confident if I contacted the support people, they could have fixed my problem.<br /><br />Some other cool features I like are the semi-sticky surface on the bottom of the speaker. This will definitely help against slipping away. Also, I like the way the volume/tuner work.  A quick press to the left/right will change the FM station, Pandora song, (or other streaming song), while a long press will lower the volume.<br /><br />Overall, this wireless speaker is one of the best speakers I've bought. Don't let it's small size deter you. The sound quality is way much better than I expected. What are you waiting for? If you're looking for a small and amazing wireless speaker, I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />Although I didn't use it, NUVUO seems to have a great return policy: We pride ourselves with our Guaranteed 100% Customer Satisfaction.

I feel like the majority of time with &#34;swiss army&#34; type _-in-1 units, the individual product feature quality is sacrificed for a larger quantity of features. This was not the case with the IT Nostalgic Classic 6-In-1. The turntable works great as well as the five other featured functions. I am very impressed with the bluetooth feature. Originally when purchasing, I figured this would be overkill and would never get used. Boy was i wrong! I am able to connect my iPhone via bluetooth without a hitch and now use the function almost as much as the turntable! The sound quality is good, not great, but quite better than what i was expecting. You wont need an ear trumpet to listen to the device from your couch but you wont have the police knocking on your door with a noise complaint either. The classic style of the device also ties in well with my home decor. It does not look out of place like other modern technological devices would. Overall, I am very impressed and would recommend!",2015-08-31

The features are ok, set up was easy and for a while it worked pretty good. The down side is only 6 months I have already had to send in for repair, something went wrong and all I could get is hissing sound form the speakers. The customer service department at Sony just plain sucks. Dealing with people that keep putting you on hold so they can read a manual and walk you through a procedure before they will tell you where to get it repaired at is ludicrous.

Got through to them on the toll free number.  No questions asked -- they are sending me a new pair.  These guys are good.  Update -- Now I get to check out the warranty.  The jack broke on the headphones -- special note don't put your phone in your pocket.  I will let you know how it works out.  The toll free number got re-directed to some 4404665800.  That is scary  -- so I had to send an email -- what could go wrong.  Hopefully, everything will work out.  My SnuggBud PUMP'D headphones developed a short @ the jack - so I went on a search for new headphones because I am too lazy solder on another jack and I wasn't going to spend another $50.  I scoured Amazon for reviews and saw the four stars on the Symphonized.  I looked @ Symphonized NRGs.  I read about others and kept coming back to the Symphonized NRG.  The bar for bass was set really high after using the SnuggBuds.  They rattled my head on the low end.  I Kept reading and looking then I decided to go for it and I ordered the Symphonized NRG then waited.  When they arrived I pulled them out of the box and pulled up youtube and hit play.  Not bad but not perfect.  I changed the rubber bits for something bigger  -- still not right -- good but they could be better. Since I wasn't using the SnuggBuds any more, I pulled the rub bits off them and put them on the NRGs.  Magic happened, the bass was almost as good as the others but the frequency range was better on the NRGs.  The NRGs had a wider range REally god bass, descent mid-range and the high were crisp.  Plus for $15 bucks, the NRGs were a 1/3 of the price and really good sounds for me.  I like great deals and this was it.  Since my lovely wife signed us up for a marathon, I thought I would try the NRGs out on a run.  I did a 5k run and only adjusted them twice.  They shut out the world just fine.

This clicking sound makes its way into the earphone cup making a distracting noise.  I took away 2 stars because I think its a design defect that distracts from an otherwise good performing Bluetooth headset.  It only clicks if your adjusting your headphones on your head so it's not constant but this could be a deal breaker for some.  For the price I paid, sound quality and lightweight compact size, I live with it.  Also, my commute is so loud on public transportation the clicks and rubbing noise don't bother me as much as it should.  Original Review: I bought these for commuting, they are lightweight fold flat and have great sound for wireless.  These are not noise cancelling but do a decent job of cutting out ambient noise from the outside.  Many different sites have mixed reviews for this headphone but for the price they met all of my qualifications.  They are comfortable to wear because they don't weigh much and they fit on my ears without clamping down on my head.  The band is stainless steel and plastic, I don't expect this to last forever but if they get me 1 year of daily use I have no problems at this price point.  The Bluetooth connection is solid and pairs quickly, I cannot tell the difference between the wired or wireless functions on the head phones.  They charge up through a standard micro USB port so it's super convenient.  Yes, there are better sounding headphones and Yes they feel a little more plastic than I like but the quality is great for what you pay.  If you want convenience, lightweight and great sound then you should consider these.",2015-08-31

US,32214650,R2QXERZL55N26P,B00TMRUKQG,970981339,Sound Bar Red,Electronics,4,0,0,N,N,Impressive little speaker,"The TaoTronics Model TT-SK02 is a nice looking portable Bluetooth speaker. It comes in an attractive, easy to open box, includes a manual in several languages, a USB charger cable, an audio cable, but no charger. You have to use the USB charger included with your phone, tablet or use the on your computer. The replaceable battery is a good thing to have. There is no indicator on the speaker of how much battery life is left. But an interesting feature is that next to the bluetooth icon on my iPhone/iPad there is a battery charge level indicator for the speaker.<br /><br />The housing is of a matt rubberized finish, which looks elegant. The status LED and all connectors are on the back and therefore not distracting. The speaker has an on/off switch but the manual is unclear on how fast the battery will drain if the speaker is left on in paired standby mode.<br /><br />The front and top of the speaker look very clean and minimalistic. There are only three buttons on the top that have multiple functions. For instance the volume buttons also act as skip forward/backward buttons and the round multifunction button controls Bluetooth pairing, play/pause, audio source selection and phone answering. There is a loud double beep when the speaker top volume is reached. The speaker uses the older Bluetooth 3 technology. Volume changes on device and speaker are independent, which is not as convenient.<br /><br />You can pair more than one Bluetooth device with the speakers. However, the manual does not list how many devices can be paired with speaker. Pairing is easy and fast.<br /><br />To switch between the devices, press and hold the MFB until you hear a double tone. This disconnects all devices within range and then you can open the BT settings on your device and connect to the previously paired speaker or pair a new speaker<br /><br />No NFC pairing with iPhone 6 is possible since the iPhone does not (yet) support this feature.<br /><br />The sound quality for such a small speaker is quite good and a lot better than the built in speakers on my phone or iPad. The speakers are advertised as 2x3W, which is not the highest you can find on the market for this size speakers but the sound quality is amazingly good and loud enough to fill a room. This allows you to listen to music, watch videos or TV on your tablet and have great sound. In my experience the sound breaks up by exceeding 20 ft distance between the paired device and the speaker, which is less than the advertised 33ft.<br /><br />The speaker has a microphone and can therefore be used, at least in theory, as a speaker phone. However, while the other party can be heard loud and clear through the speakers, the microphone did disappoint. The sound it picked up is very garbled and basically makes it useless for a conversation. I am not sure this is an issue with my particular unit but a few other reviewers reported the same problem.<br /><br />In summary this is a very good sounding, portable speaker, the built quality looks great and if the microphone would work better and the Bluetooth would be upgraded to version 4.0 I would give it 5-stars.",2015-08-31

The first time I tried to use them I panicked because I couldn't get it to pair with the phone. But if you check out the booklet it clearly states how to pair (I own a Samsung S3). A woman's voice speaks to you when you &quot;power on&quot; and &quot;power off&quot;. A red light appears while the earbuds are charging, and the blue light appears when it is fully charged. The battery lasts from 4-4.5 hours and it takes from 1-1.5 hours to fully recharge. They fit well, are lightweight and sound pretty good. To be honest I wasn't expecting them to sound as great as they do. My main reason for the purchase was for listening to music on my phone, and it does not disappoint. (I hate using earbuds that do not sound good) I listen to different genres of music, and everything sounds nice and clear with plenty of bass. I own a Jawbone Icon, and a Motorola Elite Sliver, and this set sounds better than both of those. (But those aren't earbuds, those are just the &quot;one ear&quot; type of bluetooth)The blue light blinks once every 5 seconds while the power is on. The ear 'hooks' that go on top of the earbuds are soft, flexible rubber and are removable. The cord is nice and thick, and the remote is easy to use. I like that the remote enables you to pause, play, fast forward to the next song and rewind. I wish the remote was slightly lower on the cord and not so close to the ear, but that is only a minor complaint. They are pretty good in noise reduction, so if there is someone speaking to me I usually only wear it in one ear so I can hear them talking! I have used them once during a phone call and I could hear the caller well. It was a little weird though, because it feels like you have earplugs in your ears while you are talking lol. The connection is not fool proof, when the phone is nearby, occasionally it cuts out if I turn my head a certain way or have the phone in my pocket. When the battery is low it says 'low battery', but I don't know how many times it says that because usually I turn the set off right away upon hearing the warning. I have a few reasons why I would not give the earbuds a 5-star rating. First, is because they start cutting out pretty bad after a 20-25 foot separation from the phone. But the good thing is you will hear a beep when it cuts out, and the music will pause. You will hear the beep once again when it is in range, and pressing the play button after that will start the music up where it left off. But I like to have my phone on me most of the time anyway, unless I'm charging it. Another reason is that I have to fight to get the tiny flap to open where you charge the set. I have very short nails, and I feel as if it would be easier to just grab a pair of tweezers to pry it open. A thicker piece of rubber covering the charging hole would be ideal. Last thing is, that the rubber hooks sometimes fall off. I am paranoid about losing the hooks, so I take them off of the earbuds before putting the set in the storage pouch. As another reviewer stated, it would be cool if the set went into a sleep mode or shut itself off after awhile of not using them. But it does not do that, so don't forget to shut it off afterwards! Overall, I am pleased with my purchase, it is a very affordable set, with a good sound and comfortable as well.<br />PS: On Amazon, it does state that these are 4.1 bluetooth, but the booklet that comes with the earbuds says 4.0<br />After two months of use I down rated to 3 stars instead of 4 because the pause button quit working, now it only works when your actually looking at Pandora.

US,45007223,R29Y2K8VMNG100,B0050N5JJO,491625898,uxcell 8 Way TV RF Coaxial Cable Splitter for CATV Signal,Electronics,4,2,2,N,Y,You won't get a better device at this price point,The device did split over the air digital TV signals however I experienced a 20% loss of signal in each of the 8 ports.  For example first I tested a TV directly to the antenna without splitting and it registered a 70% signal.  After splitting 8 ways it registered only a 50% signal.  This 20% signal loss was consistent in all 8 ports.  So I opted to go with an amplified splitter instead.  With the amplified splitter I experienced 0% signal loss but the price was $34.<br /><br />Bottom line is you won't get a better device at this price point so if you start out with a strong enough signal (i.e. 80-100%) you can lose 20% and still have 60-80% signal strength and still have a good digital picture.  Some of my TV's started out with only 50% so after using this splitter I netted only 30% which was not enough signal for a stable digital picture.,2015-08-31

The speaker measures 9.5x4x2.75” and weighs just over 2 lbs.

On one end of the speaker are sockets for power in (for charging the internal battery), USB power out (for charging devices), and aux (for connecting devices that do not have Bluetooth). Also on this end are a set of LED battery indicator lights and a battery check (status) button. On the top of the speaker are push button controls for volume up/down, play/pause, answer phone, and power. The top of the speaker also has a built in microphone for using the speaker as a speaker phone. The speaker is designed to be water resistant; that is, it can withstand splashes or gentle rain, but it cannot be submersed in water. Once the internal battery is charged (4-6 hours for a complete charge), it can run up to 18 hours. It can also be used to charge an external device such as a phone. The speaker can connect to a sound source (phone, iPod, computer) either wirelessly through Bluetooth or with a wired connection using the included aux cable.

Or using the speaker as a speaker phone for a telephone conversation.

That means it may have troubles tracking properly, especially on the newer 180g vinyl. It may (or may not) skip on some 180g records. Your guess is as good as mine as to which 180g LP will turn problematic. This is a huge drawback, but it is a result of a cheap built (and a low price). It does a decent job on the older LPs. The only advice an owner of LP60-USB will get from Audio-technica is... to buy a more expensive AT model (AT-LP120-USB or the AT-LP1240-USB). LP120-USB is priced at 430 CAD on the Bestbuy.ca. I will not go into detail on the stop button problems. If it stops working one day, you will have to open the turntable and manually adjust the levers. It is not difficult to do, though.<br /><br />http://answers.audio-technica.com/answers/1213-en_us/product/085561cf849acaa9/at-lp60-usb-lp-to-digital-recording-system-questions-answers/questions.htm?expandquestion=268802<br /><br />Do I recommend this turntable?

Look here for comparison to ""normal"" AmazonBasic On-Ear Headphones.","These are extremely comfortable Headphones. Not very heavy, which further adds to the comfort rating. The sound quality is more &#34;open&#34; and more detailed than the AmazonBasics On-Ear Headphones. I compared these with the AmazonBasic On-Ear Headphones (regular) and here are my findings:  + The Premium headphones have more bass presence. + Slightly more &#34;detail&#34; and cleaner sounds. For example, I can hear the &#34;hammer attack noise sound&#34; from my Casio px160 when playing sforzando, while I could not with the regular headphones. I can also hear more subtle lines in the music when there are many instruments overlapping. + Sound is more open, not as &#34;stuffy or boxy.&#34; + Better build quality - feels more solid. These have a cover on the soft material for the top piece. The ear cushions are softer and a bit larger. + Surprisingly not as hot as the regular ones. Maybe because the cushion is made from a different material? + Detachable cord!. + Relatively light. + adds more &#34;color&#34; to the songs. So music sounds slightly better, probably because there is more presence in the lower end and higher end. -  Cost about 2 - 3 times more.  Overall, I these premium headphones are better than the regular headphones in terms of build quality, sound, and comfort.  However, these do not sound not as good as the ATH m20x. Too bad the ATH m20x is too tight and too hot for me. I recommend these if you want a pair of comfortable earphones for casual listening and music enjoyment, but not for analytical listening or mixing. I am pretty certain these do not have a &#34;flat&#34; frequency response curve and are not as detail as professional headphones. Hope this is helpful for people deciding between the AmazonBasic regular headphones and the premium ones.",2015-08-31

It has cushions that allow it to sit in either the vertical or horizontal configuration with all controls accessible in either setting. The Bluetooth setup works quite nicely: I configured my iPhone to connect to it. Thereafter, when the speaker is turned on, it automatically links correctly with the iPhone. If you take the phone out of range, then back into range, it reconnects correctly. The speaker will play whatever you play on the linked device: music, telephone call, whatever....<br /><br />The unit comes with a bag for easy portability of the speaker, a mini-to-mini cable that can be used instead of Bluetooth connectivity, and a micro-USB cable for charging the internal battery of the speaker. The manual does not contain any information about the battery, and the speaker has no obvious method for battery replacement. Presumably, the speaker is meant to last only as long as the battery lasts.<br /><br />The downside of the speaker is, unfortunately, the sound quality. I found the sound to be somewhat muffled, as if the treble were turned all the way down, for both music playback and for telephone calls. Calls are intelligible, but I prefer the sound on the iPhone's built-in speaker. The benefit of the Lenovo speaker is that it's somewhat more powerful than the built-in speaker of the iPhone, so the volume goes up more and you could use this in the middle of a meeting or with a group of people to a better extent than the phone by itself. But overall, I'd want a better quality speaker within a device this size before making the choice to use this rather than just using the phone.",2015-08-31

I only have a Kodi box and Xbox One on mine, but it's really nice.  The remote is very sturdy.  Setup was also a breeze (be sure and turn your tv on since that's where the setup menu will show...took me a bit to figure that out.  hehe).<br />I like this receiver so much that I recommended it to my father in law, whose receiver was so old it didn't even HAVE HDMI.

US,3116782,R1AGGZETFNAS2U,B009QV15DU,953732012,Sennheiser Momentum Headphone,Electronics,4,11,11,N,Y,Sennheiser Momentums vs. Urbanite XLs,"TL;DR<br /> - I ordered both the Sennheiser Urbanite XLs and the Sennheiser Momentums and compared them for 30 days.<br /> - These are two quality, well-priced pairs of headphones.<br /> - I chose to keep the Urbanites, and return the momentums, for two key reasons:<br /> --- The Urbanites are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever worn, while the momentums put enough pressure on my ears that I need a break after over an hour of listening.<br /> --- The Urbanites are more portable, and can be safely tossed in a backpack without a case<br /> - The differences between the two pairs aren't in quality. Rather, there are some specific characteristics for each pair that will make some people happier with one pair or the other. A full comparison is below.<br /> - I ordered both pairs USED off of Amazon, each for around $40 off the new price. The packaging was opened but the two pairs were otherwise impeccable.<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />SOUND<br />Urbanites:  8.5<br />Momentums:  9<br />The overall sound quality was excellent in both pairs. As a former Bose employee, I can say that each of this options will give you the kind of sound you would expect out of a $300 to $400 pair of headphones. The biggest difference between them (and, generally, between any similar-quality headphones or speakers) was the equalization. As other review will tell you, the Urbanites really emphasize the mid bass a somewhat emphasize the deep bass, while the Momentums emphasize the mid range. After adjusting the equalization to account for this, the sound quality was quite similar. I still found the Urbanites to be somewhat tinny at the very top of its high range, but overall, they were both clear, crisp, and gave a very solid performance on a wide variety of tracks.<br /><br />For speech, (in this case, many hours of CS lectures), they were both excellent, and easier to listen to than my external speakers. The Momentums gave a more engrossing experience (which sounded like more like someone was right in front of you), but the Urbanites were actually a touch more comprehensible. I know this because I consistently crank up the lecture speed to 2.0x - 3.0x. With the Urbanites, I could consistently increase the speed an additional notch or two without syllables becoming unclear.<br /><br />SOUND ISOLATION<br />Urbanites:  6<br />Momentums:  9.5<br />In this category, I should emphasize that higher is not necessarily better. The momentums absolutely block out sound, and have a tight seal. While wearing the Momentums, someone right next to me can call for my attention, and I won't notice until they wave their hand. The Urbanites have good isolation (in fact, better than my last pair of phillips), but outside sound can definitely leak in. As someone working in an open office, I do prefer having some sound leak through so I don't enter a conversation around me halfway through having no idea what was going on. In this aspect, the Urbanites are a good balance for me.<br /><br />However, if total isolation is an important part of your listening experience, you will absolutely get more of that out of the Momentums. It should be noted that isolation goes both ways, and you can probably crank up your music a little louder with the Momentums without anyone hearing.<br /><br />COMFORT<br />Urbanites:  10<br />Momentums:  4.5<br />This was the deal-maker for me. I listen to music 80% of the workday, and for several hours a week listening to video lectures. I honestly have never worn a pair of headphones that is as comfortable as the Urbanites are. I can wear them 10 hours a day without any discomfort, which has never been true of other over-ear headphones for me, and certainly not true of any on-ear or in-ear headphones.<br /><br />The Momentums are by no means terrible when you put them on. However, after 1-2 hours of use, for me, I needed a break. The aforementioned tight seal is obtained by putting a reasonable amountof pressure on your temples, and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears. Your experience may vary in this regard, but it's clear that the Urbanites are the winner in the comfort category.<br /><br />AESTHETICS<br />Urbanites:  5<br />Momentums:  7<br />I'm no fashion authority, I'll just give my two cents: I don't really find any pair of over-ear headphones attractive. When they're on your head, you're going to look a little bit like mickey mouse, regardless of what headphones you choose. That said, I did find the momentums to have a nicer, refined look that I could imagine someone wearing in a highly corporate setting without a second glance.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9<br />Momentums:  7 out of the case, 10 in the case<br />The Momentums come with a nice hard-shell case which protects them well. That said, I couldn't bear the thought of anyone throwing them in a backpack without that case. The plastic top and metal sides do feel durable, but their sheer geometry allows stray items to press against their drivers, which are more vulnerable than the Urbanites', and the fact that they don't fold means that throwing your backpack down somewhere could unintentionally cause their aluminum supports to bend.<br /><br />The Urbanites' cups fold in, an awesome feature. Folded, they're less than half the volume of the Momentums' case, and they're in a more protected and flexible position. This, combined with the fact that the whole pair of headphones is incredibly flexible, makes for a remarkably durable set of cans. The drivers themselves also have a hard plastic cage over them underneath the fabric covering, which makes me less worried that stray items will press directly against the drivers and muck with their ability to perform.<br /><br />These are both pairs of headphones that look like they're built to last. If they're just sitting on your desk, I'd even put my money on the Momentums outlasting the Urbanites. However, the Urbanites are built to last inside a backpack, suitcase, or messenger bag without needing a case.<br /><br />Which brings us to...<br /><br />PORTABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9.5<br />Momentums:  7<br />The Momentums' case does deserve some credit here: It's light, it's durable, and it's a lot less bulky than some other headphones you might see. That said, it's still a case, you still have to unzip it, and you still have to adjust your headphones away from the positions that fit your head to the positions that fit the case every time you want to take them anywhere. For someone leaving their headphones at home, this probably isn't a big deal, but for someone constantly throwing them in a backpack and biking to work, it is a bit of a pain. The small folded position and flexibility in the absence of a case make the Urbanites one less thing you have to think about.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I'm not going to give an overall score: These are different pairs of headphones. The momentums give you an immersive, isolated sound experience, while the Urbanites are more comfortable and more more portable. After my month of testing, I chose the Urbanites.<br /><br />ON BUYING USED<br />These headphones both seemed worth their sticker price, but at the end of the day, I saved around $40 and got headphones that, as far as I could tell, were identical to a new pair. Obviously, your results may and will vary, but the return policy on Amazon is the same with used items as it is for new items, so you aren't necessarily stuck if you get a bad pair. I would definitely buy headphones used from Amazon again.of pressure on your temples, and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears. Your experience may vary in this regard, but it's clear that the Urbanites are the winner in the comfort category.<br /><br />AESTHETICS<br />Urbanites:  5<br />Momentums:  7<br />I'm no fashion authority, I'll just give my two cents: I don't really find any pair of over-ear headphones attractive. When they're on your head, you're going to look a little bit like mickey mouse, regardless of what headphones you choose. That said, I did find the momentums to have a nicer, refined look that I could imagine someone wearing in a highly corporate setting without a second glance.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9<br />Momentums:  7 out of the case, 10 in the case<br />The Momentums come with a nice hard-shell case which protects them well. That said, I couldn't bear the thought of anyone throwing them in a backpack without that case. The plastic top and metal sides do feel durable, but their sheer geometry allows stray items to press against their drivers, which are more vulnerable than the Urbanites', and the fact that they don't fold means that throwing your backpack down somewhere could unintentionally cause their aluminum supports to bend.<br /><br />The Urbanites' cups fold in, an awesome feature. Folded, they're less than half the volume of the Momentums' case, and they're in a more protected and flexible position. This, combined with the fact that the whole pair of headphones is incredibly flexible, makes for a remarkably durable set of cans. The drivers themselves also have a hard plastic cage over them underneath the fabric covering, which makes me less worried that stray items will press directly against the drivers and muck with their ability to perform.<br /><br />These are both pairs of headphones that look like they're built to last.

I have had mine for about a month.<br />I bought this to replace my old gen1 iHome radio alarm clock.<br />Positives: dual alarms for week days and week ends or any other day you like, blue tooth and aux jack for Iphone/ipod and other mp3 players, and several dimming levels for the clock face including off. I personally like my room very dark when i sleep so i have the display at its lowest setting before its off. I wake up to the radio and its set to slowing increase volume up to my own specified value. You can adjust whether you want it to slowly increase volume and how lowed it can get. The sound quality is also very good.<br />So far the time keeping has been very good. my old iHome would loose time about a minute or 2 every month.<br />Negatives: first hunting for your favorite radio station and making it stick is not the easiest thing in the world. I with it have a dial type control. But once its set up you should never need to change it. Second the 2 alarm off buttons are right next to each other so i almost always hit the wrong one first. My final negative is the height of the alarm clock itself. Its relatively tall next to my bed making it harder to hit to turn off or hit snooze. Not a huge issue but I would prefer a shorter version. It is a little expensive but worth the price.<br />All that said this is the best radio alarm clock i could find on the market that had sound rise technology, a very dim-able display, a FM radio, and dual alarms.",2015-08-31

The size of these headphones is ideal for the minimalist traveler--this was really important to me in my decision.  They are much more compact than any other over-ear headphone that I have seen on the market.  They are small ear cups but still fit comfortably over the ears and are quite comfortable even during longer flights.  They are not the loudest headphones in the world. I listen to them at 95-100% volume most of the time so the battery life is 5-6 hours.  Fortunately, Sennheiser made it easy to swap out battery packs ($25-35/ea).  Battery packs can also be recharged without being connected to the headphones.  Sound quality is great and have a rich tone.  But again, they are not a very loud headphone.  I do not see a big difference in sound quality between these and the Wireless Momentum 2.0.  The MM 550-X are much lighter and compact than the Momentum line.  One, last thing--these bluetooth headphones do not pair well with non-Apple products.

Waterproof Rugged Portable with built in Subwoofer and Long Battery,Electronics,3,2,3,N,Y,The horror of the charger port,"I have had this product for about a little longer than a year, and it worked great for where I worked. I lifeguard at an indoor pool and it gets quite humid in there so I needed a product that has good loud sound and could deal with the humidity inside that area, so I bought this. Instantly I fell in love with it. It played clear and the bass was decent too. I would not say it was the best, but it got the job done very well.  Everyday I would listen to music through that device as I lifeguarded the pool. It was worthwhile for that speaker and it played quality music. So, now you may be wondering why I have three stars on it. Well, today as I was guarding my speaker was playing, and it was still playing well, but it was running out of battery so I was charging it, I then noticed the charging was only working somewhat-I had to position the charger in the port for the device to charge. I initially thought it was not a big deal as products do tend to wear over time. It is inevitable. So, after I was done listening to music through this speaker, I went to go charge it again, and as I was positioning the charger so this device would charge, the charger port popped right out. Man, was I disappointed. I thought I got a one in a thousand speakers that had a faulty charger port, but I was wrong. Upon further investigation I found that there were quite a few that experienced the same problem, except it happened to them within the first few times using it.<br /><br />So, my advice is this: If you want to take the gamble that you may possibly receive a speaker that has the possibility of the charger port falling out within the next few days, to the next few years, then that is all on you. I would say purchasing this product was nice and it was good while it lasted, so i believe the gamble was worth it on my part. However, will I buy this product again? Most likely not. If this broke after 5 years of use, I would have bought another one in a heartbeat, but in this case it broke after about a year. If you have the money to throw around, go ahead and get this speaker. It is loud, plays greatly, battery life lasts long, it is rugged and waterproof (as my coworkers have accidentally dropped it on the ground and in the pool.) It is also compact and it has a nice design. But if you plan to choose really carefully, you may want to think twice before purchasing this product, for it is a gamble as to how long your usb charger port will last.",2015-08-31

But I think what happened was the part that connects to the capsule when you charge it is a bit hard to push in all the way because a tiny piece of plastic sticks out a bit and gets in the way--it's as if the part you push in sometimes does not go all the way in and so it doesn't charge and just goes dead. (The red/blue charging light doesn't come on). You have to just keep trying and eventually it comes back and charges.,2015-08-31

However, I still wanted to watch the free OTA programming that was available in my area. I originally had hooked up an un-powered Amazon basics antenna to see what kind of channels and quality we would get. With that unit, I was able to get Fox, CBS and NBC in clear HD plus a variety of other SD channels. However, I wasn't able to get ABC or PBS, so I was looking at other options to hopefully get even more channels.  When I ordered this product, I was hopeful that due to the fact that it was powered (and at a higher price point, which I probably should have known isn't necessarily a sign of quality) that I would get some additional HD stations. However, I was disappointed when I hooked up the Onh to discover that I only received one HD channel. I tried re-locating the antenna to different areas of the room to no avail. The bottom line is that my basic, un-powered Amazon antenna received much channels than the Onh. I'm sure other people will have better results than I did, but based on the set up and conditions of my location, I guess an amplified antenna isn't necessarily the answer.  Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",2015-08-31

I haven't had any issues with it other than being a bit disappointed in it's construction - especially for how expensive it is. The entire thing (except for the knobs) is pretty cheap plastic and the knobs actually pull right off if you pull straight up. To give you an idea of how light this thing is, the end of a single VGA cable that plugs in to the back of this box is heavier than the box itself. This can make it difficult to keep it on one place on your desk - especially if the box is close to the edge and the cable is hanging down off the edge. The cable might pull the box right off your desk. I'm almost tempted to glue some small weights to the inside of this box.",2015-08-31

What I received was quite disappointing. There are several things to be cautious of about this clock that the product description doesn't make clear. Here they are:<br /><br />a.) The clock is only chargeable by micro-usb cable (and they supply a cable, but you need to supply the actual plug). It is meant to run on an internal battery, which holds a decent charge, but is still less than reliable, and certainly not as reliable as keeping a clock plugged in. Each recharge takes about 6 hours.<br /><br />b.) If you turn the clock off or run out of battery, you must reprogram everything. You lose your calendar (year and month) and your time. YOu'll need to do this every time you recharge or turn off the clock.<br /><br />c.) If there is a way to get a 12 hour (rather than a 24 hour) time, I haven't found it, and the directions don't tell. I prefer 12 hour to 24 hour, so this clock is usable, but...<br /><br />d.) The clock is VERY small. I don't have exact measurements, but my 6-inch-screen cell phone is longer than the width of this clock (not just the clock face, but the entire width of the clock.)<br /><br />So, there you have it.

And while I have it locked and with it in my pocket, God forbid I lean against something that presses the buttons (still not sure if there's a specific combo) it turns the player off! Other minor things are it does not save your place after you turn it off. It seems to always go to the same random song when I turn it back on. The last-used volume setting also does not hold.

I find this WATERPROOF speaker similar to the BOOMBOX with a few improvements in design.  The WATERPROOF speaker comes in the same minimal packaging as its predecessor. Included are the wall charger/USB link cable; AUX cable; and carrying bag. This speaker has a rubber casing with a nice feel. 3 LED lights on the side show battery level and two lights on top show Bluetooth status. Setup and pairing are easy, and the same as the BOOMBOX.  As with the SHARKK BOOMBOX, this speaker doles out very nice sound with ample bass and clear mids and highs. Bluetooth connectivity is nice, but can be glitchy at times. Twice, the power button has not worked and the unit has been &#34;stuck&#34;. Bluetooth did not function when speaker was &#34;stuck&#34;. Eventually, speaker regained normal operation.  I guess what most people are interested in is whether this puppy is WATERPROOF. I subjected this speaker to a sprinkle test, or about 1 minute under the shower head to simulate leaving the speaker in the rain. I then submerged the speaker in 1 foot of water to simulate dropping the speaker in a pool or leaving the speaker on the beach. In both cases the speaker was powered on and playing music. Music play was uninterrupted for both tests and physically the speaker was unharmed. I feel comfortable claiming that this speaker lives up to its name WATERPROOF! Also, it floats.  CONCLUSION: Expect some made-in-china-electronic glitches, but the problems are minimal and ultimately the build quality and sound are excellent for the price.",2015-08-31

I like DJ type headphones because they're closed (so no one else complains about noise), blocks external noise, have a neutral sound quality (if I want to tweak the sound, I want to do it with an equalizer) and I have a strong distaste for boosted bass, as it tends to drown out the details of a musical piece.<br /><br />The closest thing I have to this is the Sennheiser HD280 Pro, which I purchased in 2003. Even taking inflation into account, this one is still about 3 times what I paid for the Sennheiser. So what's the difference?<br /><br />The most obvious difference is the build quality, The HD280 has come plastic clips on the headband. They broke within the first week of me owning it, and I was only using it at home. I fixed them in place with clear packing tape, and they've held up well over the last 12 years, but it was still very disappointing to have it break so soon after buying. The A5Pro is built like a tank. Lots of aluminum all over. It is heavier than the HD280, of course, but surprisingly not that much heavier.<br /><br />The headphones come with cushions that fit over the ear, but in my case, just barely. I'd like larger ear cushions. The cushions are easily removed and replaced with a slight twist. The included cushions are 93mm in diameter. 80mm (on-ear) and 110mm cushions are also available. The cable is detachable, locks in place when pointing down, and - this is the part I really appreciate - can be attached on either the left or the right. I thought I read that there is a shorter, non-coiled cable with mic input available that can be used on a phone, but I have not seen it for sale.<br /><br />Speaking of travel, it can fold into a really compact size, and comes with a simple cloth bag for transport. When folding the cups up, there is a pretty loud click as a plastic clip releases for it to swivel up. This is the only part I'm worried about it breaking, as it is not easily replaced.<br /><br />Sound isolation is good, but not as good as a well fitted pair of earbuds. It also works both ways - it keeps external noise out, and it keeps what you're listening to from leaking out. The cushions are nice and soft, and fairly comfortable, but if you're not used to DJ style phones, you may find them tight. And you will definitely feel the weight. My HD280 feels more comfortable, but it is like an old pair of shoes, broken in, and the comparison is not fair. I recall the HD280 felt tighter when it was new as well.<br /><br />OK, enough about the construction and the great design. How does it sound?<br /><br />It sounds great to me. I hear all the details very clearly, and it does appear to be quite neutral (I have no way of measuring this except by comparing it to other headphones, like the V-Moda M-80, which sounds a fair bit brighter. Bass is not artificially boosted (yes!) but if you're listening to a bass heavy track, you definitely can hear the bass. I tried it with a range of music, from classical, to vocals, instrumentals, rock, and it performs superbly. Compared to my HD280, it sounds more substantial. Don't get me wrong, the HD280 sounds great, but when comparing it side by side, it sounded a bit hollow. I'm sure I'm not using the correct audiophile terms for this. The difference is not great, but it is definitely there, and easily heard.<br /><br />The headphones claim to be able to handle 3500 mW. I'm not sure what 3500 mW will sound like, but I'm pretty sure it's a recipe for hearing loss. When I first plugged it into my computer, I had the volume at 40%. It was loud! On the bright side, I didn't detect any distortion even at that ridiculous level that was not there at a lower volume.<br /><br />Used with my phone, the soundlevel seemed slightly lower compared to my earbuds, but surprisingly not by much.<br /><br />The only thing that gave me pause is the price. It fluctuates a bit, but no one is ever going to describe it as &#34;inexpensive&#34;. It has a great design, solid build quality, and sounds great. Is it worth 3 times the price of the Sennheiser HD280 Pro? That's a hard question to answer if you're not a professional DJ. If you like DJ style headphones, however, it is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />Now I just need to figure out where to buy the 110mm cushions from.",2015-08-31

After a couple of drops on the floor I was apprehensive to give it to her again and began looking for an inexpensive mp3 player for her.  This one does the trick and for a great price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Simple to load music: I didn't download any music management software, instead I created folders and dragged and dropped the music on to the player.<br />-Smart: It does organize the songs by artist and album automatically even if you create folders.<br />-Inexpensive: though iPods are nice, I didn't want to spend a ton on a music player for my 4 year old. Now she can listen to her music when doing crafts, in the car, etc...<br />-Small and Lightweight: I'm not worried about it bashing into things. Though the case isn't that durable (which can also be a con)<br />-Good sound<br />-Simple on/off switch<br />-Display is decent for the price. It is in color and shows the album artwork. Don't expect a spectacular retina display.<br />-Expandable with a memory card - I didn't take advantage of this for my daughter doesn't have that big of a variety in music but it is a nice feature so that the player can hold more songs or pictures.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Can only charge on a computer: but the battery life is long so I don't anticipate bringing a computer on trips<br />-It's not an iPod: The controls take some getting used to, but I figured it out pretty quickly. The player does come with instructions that are fairly simple to follow.<br />-FM Radio isn't that spectacular.<br />-AGPtEK website is not helpful if you have a problem: I didn't have an issue, but if you do I don't think that you will get much out of it.<br />-Case is lightweight: The case is just plastic, I can see this cracking easily so you might want to get a soft bag to put it in when your child uses it. I don't think any specialty cases are made for it.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I wish it was more durable, but for the price I wasn't expecting too much.

Auditioning these over the ear headphones was a pleasure because they were comfortable, musical and effectively isolated me from surrounding distractions.  Putting these headphones through their paces I saw no need to break them in.  Whether I was listening to orchestral, solo instrument, choral and solo vocal, classical, pop, ragtime, jazz or pipe organ the sound was rich, free of audible distortion and most-importantly well-balanced.<br /><br />The same sweetness that I hear from string instruments in live concerts came through and throughout the audio spectrum from violin to bass.  The intimacy, transparency and clarity of these headphones brings through not just the music.  During a Handel oboe sonata, I could hear the instrument's keys clicking.  Every breath that the flutist was taking in my recording of Poulenc's Flute Sonata was clearly audible as was the breathing of violinist Itzhak Pearlman from his Encores album.  The high-end sizzle that comes from live cymbals was reproduced clearly through these headphones as was the bone-rattling 32-foot pipe organ notes from Virgil Fox's performance of &#34;Widor's Toccata.&#34;  The reproduction of &#34;Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint&#34; from the soundtrack of the movie &#34;Inside Man&#34; was spot-on.  These headphones produce clear, full bass notes without being overly bass-heavy or rumbly.<br /><br />For anyone who expects to hear reproduction of their music to be as close to a live performance as possible, I believe that these Bose SoundTrue headphone should satisfy.",2015-08-31

I've had some issues listening to the TV lately as I have passed 50 and am beginning to pay for a misspent youth that involved loud music and firearms.  In any event, I've had trouble hearing dialogue in some programs, especially drama and suspense.  First of all, set up was easy, as the attached photo illustrates, red goes to red and white to white, with the other end plugged into the receiver.  I didn't have the distance problems noted by the other reviewer.  I normally sit about 12 feet from the base unit and am sometimes as much as 20 feet away and the sound was fine.  My only complaint was a little bit of discomfort the first time I wore them, which diminished over the next few viewings.

At first I thought the station was having problems since all other stations were coming in just fine. So, I gave it about 30 minutes and went back to the station I was watching. Still the same message. I ran &#34;Auto Program&#34; and the antenna picked up all but this local Fox station. The transmitter is less than 20 miles away and there are no weather conditions that may be causing interference.<br /><br />My next Troubleshooting effort was to check my other TV, which has a Mohu Leaf 50 antenna. No problems found, the local Fox station was coming in just fine.<br /><br />Why the antenna just suddenly dropped reception for this station is beyond me. It worked fine for 6 days then all of a sudden the station is beyond reach for this antenna which is baffling considering other stations it is picking up are further away.

The thing I love about this product is that it's not just a stubby adapter but is a short cable. Why is this important one my ask? Well if you're like me and have a laptop like the original Yoga Pro, you will notice that the mini-HDMI port is right next to one of two USB 3.0 ports. If you already have a mini-HDMI to HDMI (or whatever else output type) cable then you will notice that the USB port is still accessible. However, if you're trying to use an adapter for a HDMI to HDMI output, a stubby adapter will block this USB port access.

I saw them as a lightning deal and I haven't looked back since I bought them. They are extremely comfortable. I have been working out since I was in high school (I'm a 23 yr. old male, lifting consistently minimum 5 times per week), and I've used Jabra Bluetooth headphones, wired iPhone headphones, and Skullcandy wired headphones. I wanted to change things up after WASTING money on Jabra's products (I don't ever recommend them).<br /><br />I bought these, got a GREAT deal on them, and love them. The band in the back does not get in the way when working out or running (I've used them during both). The sound quality is great out of them, and does cancel ALL of the noise around you. If you want to listen to anyone/hear anything, you need to take them out of your ears. The button functionality is great: you can skip songs, hold down those buttons to increase/decrease the volume, stop/start music, and obviously turn on and off. The charging port is convenient and doesn't come loose, even after handling them roughly and opening/closing it often.<br /><br />The battery life is what should be expected from a set of Bluetooth headphones. It lasts me probably 4-5 workouts, about 1.5 hours each. Do the math. Charging doesn't take a ton of time at all, and I haven't seen a decrease in the battery lifespan as I've continued to use them.<br /><br />But not all reviews can be perfect. The few and far between qualms I have with this product are: 1) the wired portion of the headphones does seem to come out of the casing a little more than desired, but never to a point that is annoying. If it's ever bothersome (and I have OCD), I just twist and push it back in. 2) they don't really work for taking/making phone calls. If you hold you phone, you can use the headphones to clearly hear the other person talking, but it's really not made for making phone calls, so don't buy them for that reason.<br /><br />Lastly, these STAY ON YOUR HEAD. They don't move, they don't come loose and eventually jar off; I can be bouncing like an idiot around my neighborhood (I imagine that's what I look like running) and they stay in perfectly. Love these things. I hope they never die! And when they do, I'm coming back for more!",2015-08-31

Again, always have earbuds in. I know my earbuds. These are terrible. They sound so muddy. There's almost no high end. Tried treble boost on my Iphone 6 plus, still terrible. Tried bass reducer and Rock, still terrible. I listened to a podcast of First Take and Lil Wayne was on it. I couldn't understand what he was saying because his voice is so deep and monotone that it was basically distorted. I listened to rock and hip hop and I still hate, hate, hate these earbuds. I don't know how they had 48 reviews at the time I bought it and all were 4 to 5 stars. You have to be kidding me. And these earbuds are not broken. They just are awful sounding. I've been buying Skullcandy with the built in mic because they are cheap and sound great especially at high volumes, but as I said, they're cheap and the mic stops working after about a month and a half because I use them so much. So I figured let me try and find a better quality earbud so I don't have to keep buying new ones. Well these are very well made, as far as feel. I have used them long enough to know if they break but I'll just keep buying my old earbuds and just keep these as a backup till a new pair comes when an old pair goes.

I'm swaying between 3 and 4 stars. For the price, this system is great sound wise. Is it the best speaker system you can find? Is the sound insanely amazing? Do the speakers reach a depth and complexity of sound that will blow your friends away? No, but this product also doesn't cost nearly as much as a surround sound set would cost that would let you answer yes to those questions. This comes with five speakers (1 center, 2 front r/l, and 2 rear r/l) as well as a subwoofer and, of course, the HD Blue Ray 3D DVD player through which all of the speakers are also controlled. All of the speakers look very nice and do have a good sound quality. The base is probably a bit better than the speakers and can produce a nice rumble and depth of bass at a rather low setting so that you're not shaking the entire room or bothering neighbors if you have shared walls.<br /><br />The set-up is actually very easy. I'm not a big techie or speaker guy, and so was a bit unsure how difficult the set up would be, but it was incredibly easy. I had the whole thing up in an hour and ready to go. The bluetooth function is nice and easy to use, very intuitive. There are quite a few sound settings, but not all of them are explained in detail in the manual. So, if you don't know a lot about sound settings (such as I don't), there will probably be quite a few functions you have to look up or otherwise not change/play around with until you get a sound level you like.<br /><br />There are several hook up options for sound and video, but I used a simple HDMI connection and the DVD player was plugged into my TV and ready to go in seconds. The menus on the player are pretty easy to navigate and find your way around. A few times of playing around with the menus and you'll have it down.<br /><br />Here's the debate between 3 and 4 stars:<br /><br />The speakers themselves are not heavy duty and don't feel high quality. They look great, very sleek, but they don't have the same feeling. That's really not a big deal since you won't be handling them often, and the two front stand speakers look pretty impressive. The other downside to the speakers is that they are pre wired, making it difficult to fix if wires ever are accidentally pulled out/separated, and the side of the wires that connect to the DVD player are clamped into one insert cable instead of the wire being abled to placed into each slot. This means you can't replace or extend the wire to the speakers. You're basically stuck with the wire you've been given regardless of the size of your living room or your choice of placement.<br /><br />This next point is what really made me aggravated with the system. Panasonic touts this model as being a smart set-up with WiFi capabilities so that you can play music from your favorite online player or stream movies from Netflix and HBO, etc. BUT, they FAIL to include the additional WiFi USB stick that is REQUIRED to use the WiFi capabilities. So you're stuck hard wiring your modem/router into the DVD box. If you want WiFi capabilities, you have to BUY the WiFi stick for around $50. Not only do you have to spend that much more for the WiFi stick after having already paid for the sound system, but the reports I've read say the stick doesn't work well and your router has to be pretty close to the stick for it to work without aggravating skipping/lagging/loading times. Regardless, it's 2015 and WiFi capabilities should be BUILT IN to the sound system rather than a company misleading you into a purchase only to make you spend $50 more to make the purchase work properly.<br /><br />Because I feel that this is so deceptive, I've decided to give this three stars instead of four. If you don't care about the WiFi function or simply want just a sound system with Blue Ray player, then this is four stars. It's definitely a good system for the price, probably hard to find better at the same price, but the WiFi thing really doesn't seem right.same feeling.

It's definitely a good system for the price, probably hard to find better at the same price, but the WiFi thing really doesn't seem right.",2015-08-31

Specifically I have paid close attention to the sound profile, and the current trend is to overdrive the bass and neglect the midrange. This little speaker by iGadgitz does a good job with the sound profile. It has a unique appearance too which makes this a most interesting little speaker.<br /><br />The most obvious feature of this speaker is of course the physical design. It looks a lot like the top of a professional microphone complete with screen and dampener. I have always thought this look is old-fashioned and so I really like the appearance. The screen is more than just a decorative, though - it is strong and provides good protection for the speaker underneath.<br /><br />When set to discoverable mode for pairing the speaker identifies itself as \\""Idol 2\\"". I paired it to my phone and it paired and connected very quickly, less than 10 seconds. It was ready to go and I started streaming music to it.<br /><br />This speaker has very god sound profile. The highs are bright and clear, no complaints there. The midrange is also very good and as a result the music has the right depth, neither sounding lifeless and hollow nor sounding like it is coming through a tunnel. The bass is a touch soft but not weak. The most important aspect of the sound profile is the midrange and I am encouraged that this speaker gets it right.<br /><br />I picked up the speaker and walked away from the source. I found that the range is between 30' and 35' before it starts cutting out or stuttering, but if the base of the speaker is obstructed it starts cutting out a lot sooner. I reversed the process and carried the phone away from the speaker, and the range was the same - approximately 30'.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice speaker and I am pleased with it. Aside from the fact that it looks cool, it sounds very good and have better-than-average range. It's a good choice if you are looking for a small speaker that looks and sounds good.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I've been using these for the past three and a half years, and I just ordered my third pair.

On both of the pairs I've had before, one of the ear buds has stopped working after a while, but I mostly attribute that to all the abuse I put them through (wires getting caught on stuff and pulling them out, cramming them into tight pockets, dropping my MP3 player and catching it by the headphones, etc.).

I had gotten him a replacement but it stopped working just about 2 weeks ago.  His school is over 5 hours away so after ordering this replacement cord from Grapevine Cables  last week he was really worried that he wasn't going to get them in time before leaving for school.  However, these arrived lightning quick and that made his day (and mine).  He wouldn't have known what to do without using his phone on the long ride to school.  We chose the red ones and since I know nothing about them, I asked him what he thought. Construction wise he felt that they were quality made and he could tell the difference right away in the way these felt versus the ones we got a few weeks back.  The wires and other pieces didn't feel flimsy at all.  It pretty much does the exact same thing that his original cord did and he said he really couldn't tell the difference as far as functionality and sound between these and the original. Thumbs up from us!  We received this product at a reduced price during a promotion in exchange for our honest and unbiased review.",2015-08-31

Using my LG G3, I have no issues with moving the phone around quickly relative to the position of the speaker. I even went crazy shaking them in my hands up and down opposite of each other. No problem with my phone. Unfortunately I am no longer near my brother so maybe there was some other environmental factor at play. Very strange though.  Original Review: The bluetooth module they use is pretty lousy. Went running with it the other day (brother had a phone, and I had speaker), and it stuttered continually. This was probably due to something similar to the doppler effect where the module was coming closer and further away all the time. Had the same issue when I held phone in one hand and speaker in the other. Then if I had phone and speaker in the same hand (very bulky), it had no suttering problems. If you wear other companies' bluetooth speakers/headphones, you would expect that there would be no stuttering as you hold your phone in your hand, but the Omaker speaker did have problems.  Besides this, the speaker seems pretty good when used in a stationary phone/speaker setting.

It's not that the amp doesn't work - it certainly does amplify the sound, but not by much. I've never used it on any volume except max, and even then I find myself turning up my iPod or portable video game consoles to hear the sound more clearly. It only makes up for a few notches on the source volume slider, and that's with the amp turned all the way up.<br /><br />I don't feel ripped off, but I do feel disappointed. At least the construction quality is good, and the battery life is... okay. I usually get a few hours - maybe three? It's hard to tell when I don't listen all at once. Charging it is simple.<br /><br />All in all, I would've felt much more satisfied if I had bought this at a $20 price point. It's not bad, but don't expect anything amazing.

It's considerabley cheaper now than  Update. 2015. I edited this review to 2 stars (up from 1 star) after contact with  MobileCityOnline's customer service and will possibly rate this higher still at a later date. More than a month after I posted the original review and a few days after I had disposed of the failed unit, I received an email from MobileCityOnline based on my poor review. They immediately offered to send a replacement unit even though I had nothing to return. I've received the replacement and it's working well. Time will tell. Part of my problem was that the Amazon site left no contact information for MobileCityOnline after the 30 day replacement period was up. I guess most folks might have thought to look for mobilecityonline.com, but it didn't occur to me.  Original review - Worked OK for a while, although the Bluetooth connection to my phone was weak - it would become intermittent when my body blocked the path from the phone to the phones. It quit altogether and apparently forever last week after just a few months of light use. It now appears to take a charge, but it cannot be turned on at all. There is no way to contact &#34;customer service&#34; of MobileCityOnline beyond the Amazon 30 day return window, so both are to blame in this case.  I feel abused.",2015-08-31

The reviews are subjective, so be careful! I play with subs quite a bit, and to be honest, my 10 inch Paradigm PS1000 plays cleaner and louder than the BIC...it's only rated at 130 watts rms. I ended up putting the BIC in a back room where it gets little play time. Mind you, it's all about your settings, placement, and overall acoustics of your room. I gave it a rigorous two week break-in period, and by then I usually know how it's going to perform in the long run. I threw just about every genre of music at it, and again my PS 1000 out shined it. True the Paradigm is a bandpass sub, and they are very hard to tune, but in my application, I'm sticking with it. Just a bit of caution, before you rush out to buy a subwoofer for your home theater, or whatever listening pleasure, don't take what you read as gospel...take some time and audition a few subs that are in your price rage...in most cases, you have 14-30 days to return it if you're not satisfied: Amazons customer service is simply amazing.

A few hours after posting the review, I received a call from Symphonized telling me that they were sending me a replacement set. Received them a day or so ago and have not had any problems thus far. I originally left a 1 star review, but have since revised it to 4 stars. Would have left 5 stars, but it took some additional effort just to get a working product.

US,40053317,R88RERIQDYDT5,B011SLD1NC,379220827,Apple iPod Touch 16 GB,Electronics,2,17,26,N,N,"Good Product, crappy battery","First of all, anyone looking to purchase this product, you can buy almost any android phone and an SD card for more storage if you need one and use the phone over wifi only. This works with all or most android phones. If you need instructions on how to bypass activation screens those are usually available by googling, but most of the time, you can just do it with a few button presses. I have set up many this way and never had a problem. This will meet your portable music and app needs at a much lower price. This setup does exactly the same thing that the iPod touch does, only for a cheaper price. Only buy this if you must have apple products, or if you rely on iOS exclusive apps for some reason.<br /><br />This is a good product, it seems at first, however the device's battery will not last. The battery in the device is very small and low capacity and is just over 1000 mah. If you expect longevity (more than 1-2 years of use) do not buy this. The battery is sealed inside and cannot be replaced. The device is glued together, it doesn't come apart with screws for easy battery replacement like some iPhones do. Most shops will not replace the battery for this reason, so you can't just take it to that place in the mall and have the battery replaced. When the battery is dead in a year or a year and a half, or when it dies out of warranty and apple doesn't replace it for you don't be surprised. Apple care will only replace the battery within 2 years if it has been depleted more than 50%, so in order to get a replacement battery or device and extend the life of your device past the 1-2 years that the battery will inevitably last you must buy applecare (which adds to the price of the device) and hope that they replace your device or battery when it stars to fail.<br /><br />When the battery starts to fail this device will become extremely annoying, battery will drop from 100% to 20% in less than 5 min, or it will drop as soon as you open your favorite app, then the 20% charge indicator will pop up. It may pop up many times since the battery will fluctuate and the notification will just keep appearing every few seconds. When this starts happening expect to charge 4-5 times per day. The device may also shut off unexpectedly in the middle of use.<br /><br />This device is NOT an iPhone, it does not show battery percentage, it cannot show battery percentage. It doesn't have the speaker and the mic in the same locations as the iPhone so if you want to make a facetime call or a google voice call you will have to either use a headset with a mic or hold the device in a strange way so that you can hear the other person talking and the sound will most likely be distorted. You have no idea how much battery you have left in the device at any given time, since the battery meter constantly fluctuates. It will show its full then if you use an app for 5-10 min it could drop to 50% then when you close the app it could rebound up to 90%. The battery meter is constantly going up and down. The device does not drain battery consistently, it doesn't drain evenly in a downward trend like every other device I have used does. This device is also missing the brightness sensor, so it does not adjust the brightness of the screen automatically.<br /><br />If you are playing games, and lets face it most who are buying this device as a gift for a child who does not have a smartphone then the battery will deplete in a couple hours at best, it may even need a charge after as little as one hour if you are playing a very graphically and processor intensive game. Expect the battery to die very quickly very often if you are giving this to a game playing child. Games are one of the most processor intensive tasks you could do on this device and also the most battery draining. Expect the device to die quickly when they forget to charge it or during a long road trip or those long grocery trips when it is needed the most.<br /><br />Wifi - this device REQUIRES wifi to work, otherwise, you have to activate the device and load music, games and songs and apps on it through a computer. If you are not in a wifi hotspot then you will be very limited on what you can do on it. I do not find the wifi on these devices to be very strong, the iPod touch will show 1-2 available wifi hotspots in any location, and I will see 5-10 on an android device that is held right next to it. I have been able to connect to wifi hotspots on an android device that I cannot connect to on an iPod touch device. As far as games, most games these days require a wifi connection to start up, even if they seem like they will work without wifi, and you don't really know until you leave a hotspot or disconnect your device from whatever hotspot you are using and test the game you like the most. If your favorite games don't start up without wifi then this could leave you with no entertainment if there is no wifi around where you want to play them. Some wifi hotspots will also connect, but then you won't be able to do anything on them. I call it a fake connect, it acts like its connecting, but when you go to use an app that requires wifi it will show a not connected error.<br /><br />I have owned several iPod touch models. all suffer the same battery problems, all of them exhibit the same battery depletion after one year or one year and a half of use, which is of course just outside of the apple factory supplied apple warranty of one year. I have owned enough of these to know that the iPod touch is an inherently flawed device. This device is no exception. Yes this device has just been released, but it has the same exact problems every other iPod touch has.<br /><br />If you must have a portable apple product for a non-smartphone user, I would recommend a second hand iPhone over this, since the battery can be replaced in most of them. Otherwise if portability is not that important, I would recommend something from the iPad line, I have an iPad and the battery lasts forever in it, and it can go for 2 weeks or more at a time on one charge depending on how I use it. Most of the time I only charge it once a month! I have had the same iPad for like 3-4 years and it shows no signs of slowing down and no sign of battery depletion at all. It may cost more, but its worth it for a device that will actually last.herwise, you have to activate the device and load music, games and songs and apps on it through a computer.

It tends to slide off when the device isn't attached and I'm always looking to see where it fell.

They fall down behind my desk on a regular basis. I redecorated my office a few months ago in bright colors and the pink and orange fit in perfectly. They keep those cables orderly and on the desk where they belong.<br /><br />I should note that these cable drops are of good size and can handle either a very narrow cable (like a Lightning cable or USB) or a heavier cord (like a lamp cord, ethernet or power cable). Or, you could even get several narrow cables in each if you wanted to.<br /><br />Such a simple thing, but they have saved me so much time hunting down fallen cables already. I wish I'd had these long ago! Life is too short to put up with wayward USB cables and cords.<br /><br />I should also mention that they openings are wide enough to accommodate those flat, tape-style charging cables.

It has come in useful in many different ways, I connected my daughters' cheap headphones to it and they became wireless, the play/pause button worked fine with amazon instant video app, and she had fun playing a game where I was playing minecraft on her tablet and she was identifying the terrain I was walking on or through as she had the headphones on walking in the other room.  It works well to make those old speakers you have laying around the house.  It also was useful in the car, instead of fumbling around for your phone or tablet if you are listening to music, you have a nice big button to hit that will play and pause your media.  If you hold the button down for a couple of seconds, it will trigger &#34;OK Google&#34; and you can do you google searches with your phone or tablet.<br /><br />Cons:  It did seem to hit and miss regarding the apps it supported, the main stream apps it was able to interact with, while other apps it wouldn't play or pause anything, so if you are going to be using any app with this that you need it to play or pause, I would test it before real world use.  I didn't like 1 hour battery life I got out of it, and it won't work while charging.  It took me about an hour to charge the device, if you could use it while charging it would be a great device.

I spent hours and hours reading lists of 'best earbuds' I found on the web and reading reviews here on Amazon. I finally decided to try these out as a pretty inexpensive headphone to use for daily listening and to wear at the gym. My first impression is that they were a little difficult to 'get in.' Twisting them forward the right angle, and adjusting the memory wire behind the ears, I had to look in the mirror to get them in the right spot. These are more difficult to take in and out than other pairs I've had, so I wouldn't recommend them if you need to pop them in and out frequently. The memory wire behind the ear also becomes uncomfortable after a short length of time. I haven't even been able to stand wearing these earbuds for the entire length of my workouts. I take them out halfway through because they start to hurt and the transfer noise I'll mention next gets really annoying. The noise from the cords brushing against something (microphonics I think it's called from the review I read?) is unbearable with these headphones. When I was researching before my purchase, I read reviews that mentioned this issue, but I hadn't really understood what they were referring to as I never had this problem with my Bose earbuds. The cords of these earbuds are pretty stiff and seem like they would be tangle free but they always get tangled in my gym bag. I can't really attest to the sound of these because I've listened to talk radio with them and couldn't stand to wear them longer than that! Haven't even tried them with music. I wish I had just purchased another pair of Bose instead of wasting the money on these!",2015-08-31

I already own the Sharkk Boombox and have really enjoyed that product. The Sharkk 2o has taken an already great speaker and made it better. I typically use my portable speaker outdoors when I am in the pool or hot tub (or various random locations usually with a bottle of beer nearby). While I have never knocked my speaker in a body of water, I am always worried about it getting splashed or spilled on or dripped on. The 2o takes care of that concern by making this speaker waterproof. I love being able to listen to music near the water without being vigilant about my young daughter being too splashy or accidentally tipping a drink onto my speaker.<br />The unit sounds great and has a long lasting battery. I have been using it all weekend, probably about 6 hours total and haven't needed to charge it up (in fact it still has 2 of the 3 display lights lit up which indicate the amount of charge remaining). I love both the long battery life and the remaining charge display features. Few things are worse than thinking you have a party's worth of charge and then having the battery on your speaker die.<br />The speaker comes with an audio aux. cable so that you can connect it to your music source if you want to conserve charge or do not have bluetooth capability. It also features a micro SD card slot so you can play music even without a smart phone or mp3 player. I tried this feature out and thought it was great. You can even skip songs with the buttons on top of the unit. All of the jacks and the card slot are protected by a removable rubber flap to keep moisture and dirt out. It closes easily by pushing in but I ran my finger around the edge of the flap firmly to make sure it was properly sealed.<br />I found it easy to connect to my phone, you simply turn on the speaker, turn your music player's the bluetooth on and hold down the play/pause button and it tells you when it is connected (it actually says &#34;connected&#34; so there is no doubt).<br />I love the look and design of this speaker, it is fairly small but packs a great sound. I find myself using more than my in home stereo system because it sounds so great and I can take it with me where I go (it even comes with a velcro carrying strap).<br />I have tried many wireless speakers and this is my favorite by far. I have lost more than one due to dropping (in water and on hard surfaces) so knowing that this is waterproof and shockproof is very reassuring.<br />I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants big sound in a small, waterproof package.<br />Note: I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.love the look and design of this speaker, it is fairly small but packs a great sound.

It is sonic-welded so you can't even take a look inside.  Don't waste your money.  UPDATE: I have revised my star power from 1 to 4.  Another reviewer alerted me to the fact the unit must be powered up AFTER all other connections have been made or it won't work.  He was right.  It works fine as long as you apply power last.

User Error is possible though.,"Update 11/16/2016: So with my review now being almost a year old, I thought I would discuss this product a bit more. While I still stand by this being one of the better HMDs' on the market, the truth is the market hasn't really grown for HDMI accepting HMDs'. Meanwhile VR headsets are gaining a lot of popularity and may do what a lot of users want for a fraction of the costs. If you have a Samsung Phone specifically and are only interested in media consumption (movies, tv, netflix, etc). Don't look at this product, get yourself a Samsung VR Headset and enjoy one of the clearest and sharpest pictures you've ever seen. If you have any other phone, truthfully I'm not sure how &#34;good&#34; google carboard is for media consumption and I would really recommend you looking into that if your phone isn't to dated. Something else about the Samsung VR is there are ways to stream PC games to the headset.  However, if you need HDMI input from your HMD, not much else is out at this point. Avegant Glyph came out, but all the reviews say the heaset included isn't very good, the picture size is small and that it's uncomfortable after a short while. For a device that came out at $800, I expected more. Even now it's double the costs of the MyBud.  That said, my usage of the MyBud has really dropped due a change of pace in my life. But, I'm leaving on a trip for thanksgiving next week was searching for alternatives to the MyBud and it still appears to be the best if I want to do some console gaming =\  Update 11/17/2015: After owning these for a few months and actively discussing and answering questions for these. I feel it's important to stress some points that I've noticed come up. First off, if you need a television for your home, but are considering HMD technology, do not buy these. These are great for what they are. However, these are currently more of a novelty item and should be viewed as such. If you're a hardcore gamer, television or movie watcher, these aren't for you. These are a pair of glasses that allow you to play games or watch movies in situations that typically wouldn't be optimal with a television (Airplane, Road Trip, Bed while others are trying to sleep, etc). Everyone ask for some kind of baseline for quality. So here is the closest I can come up with, think of an off-brand television such as Emerson, Element or store based brands like Dynex (best buy). They're not terrible televisions, but they're certainly not a Kuro Plasma or some of the newest Sony or Sharp Televisions. So consider this as nothing more than a toy at a great price (relative to the market) and I think you'll find these pretty awesome. Consider this as your only way to watch television or play games and you may very well hate these. That said, at this price point, projectors and televisions most likely aren't going to be much better in quality unless you snag a great deal or a smaller television.  Another Update: A few months back, the arm on my personal pair of MyBuds, broke. I was able to super glue it back, so it's still functional, etc... There appears to be a way to switch out the arms, but I have not done any kind of searching on the matter at this point. I'm not sure if I just have a big head or what, so keep that in mind =\.  Before I start this review, I want to warn people of the potential user errors that may come up. I consider myself quite tech savvy, but faced with a product that included very little in documentation - in English or otherwise-, made some issues come up. Upon retrieval of the item, it would not boot up at all. As soon as I told Amazon I wanted a replacement (about two hours of charging) it finally turned on. So first issue, if the battery is completely dead, it will not power on, regardless of it being connected to the wall charger. Upon booting it up, the image may appear very blurry... There are little sticky pieces of plastic over the lens to protect from scratches. I was not expecting this and being that this product is one of the only HDMI HMDs on the market, I immediately assumed it was just not a very good one. I didn't run into this problem having read the other reviews, but remember that you will need a power adapter for the Type C plug that comes with this.  A little bit of background, I have a Sony HMZ-T2 and really like it for the most part. But, no matter how good the OLED screens are, they can only make me endure so much pain before needing to take them off. I currently use the construction hat mod, but it simply takes the pain away from my nose and puts it on the back of my head, which in bed is not very comfortable. So I wanted something more practical that would allow me hours of enjoyment without needing to constantly fiddle with it for comfort.  The AccuPix MyBud really does deliver in comfort. The image is fairly sharp, colors aren't bad and the &#34;screen&#34; is a nice size. A big issue I have with the Sony Headset is that it has a really great FoV, well this is cumbersome for games with a radar, as it can be quite difficult to keep track of it while you're playing the game. The MyBud has a relatively smaller FoV, so instead of feeling like you're in a movie theater, you feel more like there is a 60-80 inch television a few feet away from you.  The Accupix also wins hands down in portability. The Sony HMZ-T2 requires a constant power supply and has a lot more bulk to it. The Accupix has an internal battery and is very easy to setup with other devices, whether that be a cell phone or hdmi source (remember you need a mini hdmi adapter or cable). At this time I have not tried the 3D on this device, as honestly I have a 3D projector and television for that. I will say that the 2d to 3d is nothing special though and I would say it's nowhere near as good as some of the internal programs on some of the more popular 3d televisions (LG, Samsung, etc).  A major downfall that the Accupix comes with however, is that the headphones do not seem to be easily replaceable for yourown set. Their are two separate jacks for each ear and a set of headphones that do not seem to be 3.5mm... Haven't researched it enough to know if they're 2.5 or some other random number. So this could lead to making it hard to replace them if one or both of the headphones decide to die or become damaged. Also, the headphones are in-ear, so for people like my wife with very small ear canals, it can either be painful or just not possible, regardless of the &#34;size&#34; in-ear rubber chosen. A solution for gamers on the PS4 and Xbox one is simply to just use headphones through their controller, or if you have a Roku 3 you can also use the remote headphone jack.  Another issue there is absolutely no menu settings... At least not that I've found. Again, no documentation and very little info on this product. Maybe there is a secret menu that can be entered through a program or button sequence, but I've yet to see one. This means that some things may not always appear as you would like, like to sharp or not sharp enough.  Despite the small downfalls that come with this headset (Type C plug, little documentation, no settings, proprietary headphones?, etc), I would certainly say this is one of the best products on the market. At this time of writing the Vuzix 1200 is the next closest thing at an outrageous price from the official website. The sony headsets are to cumbersome and bulky. The Avegant Glyph is not even on the market yet and is double the price... Plus initial reviews of the prototypes are saying they're very heavy on the nose after awhile. My only regret with this thing at this point, is that I bought a Sony HMZ-T2 before it... It's hard not to compare the LCD screens to the OLED.  Should I ever play with the 3D features or find anything else that I find is relevant to add to this review, I will. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.",2015-08-31

US,3116782,RZETLPHZJFYB8,B00M3NZKA2,323890891,Sennheiser Urbanite XL Over-Ear Headphones,Electronics,5,23,24,N,Y,In-depth comparison of the Sennheiser Momentums vs. the Urbanite XLs,"TL;DR<br /> - I ordered both the Sennheiser Urbanite XLs and the Sennheiser Momentums and compared them for 30 days.<br /> - These are two quality, well-priced pairs of headphones.<br /> - I chose to keep the Urbanites, and return the momentums, for two key reasons:<br /> --- The Urbanites are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever worn, while the momentums put enough pressure on my ears that I need a break after over an hour of listening.<br />  --- The Urbanites are more portable, and can be safely tossed in a backpack without a case<br /> - The differences between the two pairs aren't in quality. Rather, there are some specific characteristics for each pair that will make some people happier with one pair or the other. A full comparison is below.<br /> - I ordered both pairs USED off of Amazon, each for around $40 off the new price. The packaging was opened but the two pairs were otherwise impeccable.<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />SOUND<br />Urbanites:  8.5<br />Momentums:  9<br />The overall sound quality was excellent in both pairs. As a former Bose employee, I can say that each of this options will give you the kind of sound you would expect out of a $300 to $400 pair of headphones. The biggest difference between them (and, generally, between any similar-quality headphones or speakers) was the equalization. As other review will tell you, the Urbanites really emphasize the mid bass a somewhat emphasize the deep bass, while the Momentums emphasize the mid range. After adjusting the equalization to account for this, the sound quality was quite similar. I still found the Urbanites to be somewhat tinny at the very top of its high range, but overall, they were both clear, crisp, and gave a very solid performance on a wide variety of tracks.<br /><br />For speech, (in this case, many hours of CS lectures), they were both excellent, and easier to listen to than my external speakers. The Momentums gave a more engrossing experience (which sounded like more like someone was right in front of you), but the Urbanites were actually a touch more comprehensible. I know this because I consistently crank up the lecture speed to 2.0x - 3.0x. With the Urbanites, I could consistently increase the speed an additional notch or two without syllables becoming unclear.<br /><br />SOUND ISOLATION<br />Urbanites:  6<br />Momentums:  9.5<br />In this category, I should emphasize that higher is not necessarily better. The momentums absolutely block out sound, and have a tight seal. While wearing the Momentums, someone right next to me can call for my attention, and I won't notice until they wave their hand. The Urbanites have good isolation (in fact, better than my last pair of phillips), but outside sound can definitely leak in. As someone working in an open office, I do prefer having some sound leak through so I don't enter a conversation around me halfway through having no idea what was going on. In this aspect, the Urbanites are a good balance for me.<br /><br />However, if total isolation is an important part of your listening experience, you will absolutely get more of that out of the Momentums. It should be noted that isolation goes both ways, and you can probably crank up your music a little louder with the Momentums without anyone hearing.<br /><br />COMFORT<br />Urbanites:  10<br />Momentums:  4.5<br />This was the deal-maker for me. I listen to music 80% of the workday, and for several hours a week listening to video lectures. I honestly have never worn a pair of headphones that is as comfortable as the Urbanites are. I can wear them 10 hours a day without any discomfort, which has never been true of other over-ear headphones for me, and certainly not true of any on-ear or in-ear headphones.<br /><br />The Momentums are by no means terrible when you put them on. However, after 1-2 hours of use, for me, I needed a break. The aforementioned tight seal is obtained by putting a reasonable amountof pressure on your temples, and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears. Your experience may vary in this regard, but it's clear that the Urbanites are the winner in the comfort category.<br /><br />AESTHETICS<br />Urbanites:  5<br />Momentums:  7<br />I'm no fashion authority, I'll just give my two cents: I don't really find any pair of over-ear headphones attractive. When they're on your head, you're going to look a little bit like mickey mouse, regardless of what headphones you choose. That said, I did find the momentums to have a nicer, refined look that I could imagine someone wearing in a highly corporate setting without a second glance.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9<br />Momentums:  7 out of the case, 10 in the case<br />The Momentums come with a nice hard-shell case which protects them well. That said, I couldn't bear the thought of anyone throwing them in a backpack without that case. The plastic top and metal sides do feel durable, but their sheer geometry allows stray items to press against their drivers, which are more vulnerable than the Urbanites', and the fact that they don't fold means that throwing your backpack down somewhere could unintentionally cause their aluminum supports to bend.<br /><br />The Urbanites' cups fold in, an awesome feature. Folded, they're less than half the volume of the Momentums' case, and they're in a more protected and flexible position. This, combined with the fact that the whole pair of headphones is incredibly flexible, makes for a remarkably durable set of cans. The drivers themselves also have a hard plastic cage over them underneath the fabric covering, which makes me less worried that stray items will press directly against the drivers and muck with their ability to perform.<br /><br />These are both pairs of headphones that look like they're built to last. If they're just sitting on your desk, I'd even put my money on the Momentums outlasting the Urbanites. However, the Urbanites are built to last inside a backpack, suitcase, or messenger bag without needing a case.<br /><br />Which brings us to...<br /><br />PORTABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9.5<br />Momentums:  7<br />The Momentums' case does deserve some credit here: It's light, it's durable, and it's a lot less bulky than some other headphones you might see. That said, it's still a case, you still have to unzip it, and you still have to adjust your headphones away from the positions that fit your head to the positions that fit the case every time you want to take them anywhere. For someone leaving their headphones at home, this probably isn't a big deal, but for someone constantly throwing them in a backpack and biking to work, it is a bit of a pain. The small folded position and flexibility in the absence of a case make the Urbanites one less thing you have to think about.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I'm not going to give an overall score: These are different pairs of headphones. The momentums give you an immersive, isolated sound experience, while the Urbanites are more comfortable and more more portable. After my month of testing, I chose the Urbanites.<br /><br />ON BUYING USED<br />These headphones both seemed worth their sticker price, but at the end of the day, I saved around $40 and got headphones that, as far as I could tell, were identical to a new pair.

It is a great solution as traveler's on-the-road charger. It has one 1A port and one 2.1A port. Great for my iPhone and Kindle Fire when out on the road.<br /><br />The charger is very thin and has folding US style AC Prongs. For the traveler it takes very little space in your bag and the folding prongs help it fit more easily in full bags.  The design of the case is very thoughtful. With the prongs folded mine has no rough edges to catch a thread or damage stuff it's packed in with.<br /><br />In use the charger works great with my Kindle Fire or a Windows 8 tablet and my iPhone 6. In the 2.1A port the Kindle fire charges fast as any charger. The same with the iPhone. The charger gets warm to the touch with charging 2 deeply discharged devices. But not uncomfortably warm at all.<br /><br />In conclusion this simple product just works and proves that size matters in travel chargers. Careful design to take little space and not endanger my clothes with sharp edges or corners to cause a pull or run is appreciated by me. This very compact product is simple and gets the job done. That's a 5 star item for me.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!<br /><br />UPDATE:: Oct 10, 2017:<br />I've been using this for over 2 years it's perfect for when I travel. I am more concerned than ever with saving space in my bags and this charger is perfect in that aspect. It continues to charge my phone and the tablet I travel with very well.

Yes!  Best Sounding?  More than likely.  Most durable?  Definitely YES on that one.  Durability is certainly their middle name and with a price tag like that, you will definitely appreciate it.  The frame is composed from light metal material, so while they are solid and tough to break, they do come at a cost of being slightly heavy than your average headphones.  They are about 14 ounces.  They are certainly not subtle either if you choose to wear them outside.  Certainly they can cause fatigue after a prolonged use.<br /><br />It includes a 3.5 - 6.3 mm adapter for DJ purposed, but it will certainly play on your phone as well(I was able to use it just fine on a Samsung S4 phone.)  There is just ONE pair of ear cushions, which should fit most ears out there.  However, for a price tag like that, they could've added several instead of making you buy addition sizes for extra price.<br /><br />These are not in a direct competition with Dr Dre beats as I don't think that is what Philips is trying to do here.  Dr Dre is more stylish and designed for personal use, while these are designed for personal and DJ use and are extra durable.  Sure, they are pricey, but as always -- you get what you pay for!

If you look at the fine print on your wall wort (using a high power microscope ;-) you will see that they will take 110-220 VAC.  So these are just PLUG ADAPTORS.

My boyfriend was able to put together the mount and hang it in under than 30 minutes.  It only required two people for the hanging of the TV itself (the mount screws into the TV).  It was a super painless experience, and after a few days of having it, I LOVE it.  It looks so professional to not be able to see the mount at all.  And it moves with ease, but not so easy that it moves without you wanting it to.  It tilts 360 degrees and has a pretty large range of movement.  Not to mention the well thought out packing.  It came with a small level to help you install the mount, and a very nice corded HDMI cord that is 10' long in case you need a longer cord than what you were using with the TV closer to the ground.  I would highly recommend this TV mount!!",2015-08-31

They say to order the same size (s/m/l- not the line #) that you'd normally use in the stock silicon tips.  My version of this is to compare it to using compressible foam ear-plugs.  If you can roll a set of foam ear-plugs up and insert them as per instructions and have them be all but unnoticeable in your ears- go for the size large.  If you put in foam ear-plugs and they just peek out off your ears, go for medium.

Philips ""L2BO/27"" Open Back High Fidelity Headphones: A Critical Review.,","One thing is perfectly clear to me with regard to CNET and their recommendations-- they definitely have preferences. But, on the whole their recommendations are far better and reliable than other &#34;established&#34; media outlets.<br /><br />As I type this review I'm listening to MoFi's version of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald's second album of duets, Ella and Louis Again. And, it's listening to premium recordings where the you can hear and feel the difference between brands and models.<br /><br />The L2BO/27 is first and foremost, a &#34;Prosumer&#34; grade headphone, which is to say it is (and supposed to be) significantly better than consumer grade headphones of any and all varieties. This means not only sound reproduction but the quality of material used. And, these L2BO is made with premium leather and metal siding from end to end, no plastic here. Plus, you also get a beautiful carrying bag and stereo plugs for your home system.<br /><br />*** Burning In ***<br />Now, because these are premium Prosumer grade, these must be burned in for at least a day. By burning in, I mean plugging in the headphones into a stereo system and letting various music played through for hours at high volumes. What this does is to create flexibility in the speaker cone. The skin of the speaker becomes more in tune with the music signal and is better able to translate those subtle signals that are always there. To the end, this means that you're actually hearing sounds clearer and cleaner than what you're able to hear on consumer/budget priced headsets.<br /><br />Prosumer sets like this Philips should also provide a very comfortable listening experience for at least several hours and I absolutely feel you can have these on for 4-6 hours with fatigue.<br /><br />*** Style of Headphones ***<br /><br />These are what the industry calls &#34;Open Back&#34; (as opposed to the more popular &#34;Closed back&#34;) headphones. There are considerations that must be taken when considering this model or any Open Back headsets.<br /><br />The Open Back headsets feature an air open on the ear piece to allow air to circulate BUT it's primarily there for the drivers that transmits the sound signals. In an Open Back headset, the full (360 degree) range of the drivers is transmitting a signal. That is the side facing your (and my) eardrums but also the back side. This produces a sound that is free and not muffled by, for instance, a closed back design that has to have design which the sound coming from back side of the driver is either reflected back to the front or it is blocked by the closure of the speaker wall.<br /><br />The downside (if you can call it that is, you hear exterior noise through the opening that is means for the backside/ opposite side of the drivers.<br /><br />The Open Back Style is generally NOT recommended for outside use or in an area where there's a lot of noise.<br /><br />This style of headphone is for private, quiet room listening of CD's, DVD-audio or SACD premium recordings.<br /><br />I love the sound that these headphones produce and it's is my opinion that it is better than CNET's 4 star rating. It's 4.5 or better, especially if you have priceless uncompressed music that you wouldn't waste your time listening to with consumer grade headphones.<br /><br />These are exceptional and, in my opinion, are a far better value than some of the trendy name brand headphones<br />Commenting this model or any Open Back headsets.<br /><br />The Open Back headsets feature an air open on the ear piece to allow air to circulate BUT it's primarily there for the drivers that transmits the sound signals.

The sound quality it superb on every genre of music I listened to with them. The only possible draw back i can give about these headphones is that the wire's do give a somewhat recognizable reverb when touched, although to be fair i have noticed this on all of the other noise canceling headphone's I've used in the past so I don't count that as a huge issue.

It is a small speaker with unusual controls. Unusual in this case is not a bad thing, though - this is a good speaker that works well.<br /><br />This is a small and attractive little speaker, a little smaller than a 1-cup measure. It is a cylinder with a recessed speaker in the middle of th top, hence the name. It has a brushed steel finish on th outside and overall is not unattractive.<br /><br />I ran into a slight problem when I was testing with it that proved to be a minor issue and was easily remedied - in the middle of testing, it ran out of battery power. When the battery was exhausted, the speaker simply cut off with no indicator that the issue was coming. While that's ok, it would have been nice to have had a little warning that the battery was dying. Other than this little detail, this speaker has not given me any issues at all.<br /><br />It pairs and connects with no issue. When turned on and set to pair, it broadcasts its ID as \\""Volcano 2\\"". I paired it to my phone and it very connected and was ready to go in a few seconds, faster than most other speakers I have used.<br /><br />I fed some music to it and it demonstrated a good sound profile. The bass is a little soft but not unacceptable. The midrange is good and as a result the music has a decent amount of depth, sounding neither hollow or like it came from a tunnel. The highs are good and are very clear. When it comes to the sound profile of Bluetooth speakers many tend to overdrive the bass and kill the midrange, but this one is better with the midrange - very much preferable.<br /><br />Where this speaker gets interesting is in the volume control. The control is actually a movable ring on the underside of the speaker and by turning the speaker while it's on a flat surface it is possible to adjust the volume up or down. It took me a little practice to get this right, and I conferred with the documentation to make sure. This is one of those rare cases with a Bluetooth speaker where I do recommend reading the included documentation.<br /><br />Operating range is somewhere between 30' and 35' before it starts to cut out or stutter. This is above average and just makes this speaker even better.<br /><br />I like this speaker. It has good sound, good range and interesting controls. The fact that it looks cool is a bonus.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.right, and I conferred with the documentation to make sure.

I tried a Samsung programmable and punched in every code known to man, but nothing worked. I next tried this, but it did not work either.

It was only after several failed attempts (on my end) that we decided the remote would not work and they sent a return slip.

The sound quality is a huge step above the standard iPhone buds, but just about anything is an upgrade to those.

I wore these while weed-eating on a day when the temps were in the high 80s, so they definitely got wet.<br />- Stays in ears securely, though if your ears do not have pronounced ridges your performance may vary.<br />- Good sound quality, with a decent compromise between filtering out some outside noise but allowing enough in for awareness of one's surroundings.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- The cord seems flimsy and tangles easily.  I much prefer the flat ribbon type cable design used in other sports earbuds.<br />- No microphone for use with cell phones.<br />- Price point:  $150 is very high for these, considering that the sound quality is good but not stellar.

The highs are bright, but the bass has more of a presence without being boomy or muddy.  I was actually very impressed with them the first time I fired them up.  For $40, I was expecting the sound of $20 headphones, but with the addition of BT.  Pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The Bluebuds X have more subdued highs, with slightly more exaggerated bass.  To me, a bit less clarity, which is unfortunate because it's nearly 3-4X the cost of the BLU-100.<br /><br />Where the BLU-100s fail is reception.  If you keep the full length of the cord draped across your back, most likely your reception will be fine.  I attempted to shorten the cord by folding it over itself, a la the Bluebuds X, but once you do, you lose MASSIVE range on the headphones.<br /><br />My original intent was to use the BLU-100 (with its long cord folded on itself and tied behind my head) paired with my android wear Moto 360 smartwatch.  But, when the cord is folded, you BT signal becomes weak and the audio becomes choppy.  But, if you allow the BLU-100 to drape without any folding of the cord, reception works fine on the android wear device.  For me this wasn't an option so I had to return it.<br /><br />Otherwise, the fitment is fine with the comply tips, and I had no issues with these staying in while sprinting.",2015-08-31

In fact, overall, I am somewhat disappointed in these Bose headphones.<br /><br />A little back story. Two decades ago, I had purchased a very expensive pair of Bose headphones. I purchased them from a high-end stereo store, and the salesman at the time (a friend) said that they were overpriced for the audio quality. &#34;You're buying the name&#34; he told me. My dad, though, had a pair of Bose speakers he had picked up on his way back from Vietnam, and I LOVED the audio quality. My friend told me I could get another pair of headphones for fifty bucks cheaper that sounded a lot better. I didn't listen, purchased the Bose, and went home to enjoy my CDs. A week later, I returned the headphones, and got the less expensive pair. (KOSS) My friend was correct after all. At that point, I swore off Bose as expensive but not as good in audio quality. I took on his mantra as my own. &#34;Your buying the name.&#34;<br /><br />This brings us to these Bose headphones. They are the first Bose I have owned since the early 1990s. I didn't want to bias my opinion, so I went in with an open mind. Usually a fan nowadays of Shure and AKG, I was really interested to see (hear) if Bose had pushed past the &#34;more money for less quality&#34;<br /><br />Sadly, no.<br /><br />The first time I started to listen to them, I was happy. They sounded pretty full, bright, and clear. They do a decent job of blocking regular sounds, but are terrible on an airplane. After an hour, though, I realized that something was off. I switch over to my normal AKGs and found out that the Bose were mudding the bass. I didn't notice at first, but the more I listened, the more noticeable it became.<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to like these headphones. They are very comfortable to wear, a big selling factor for me. In comfort alone, I would rank these an almost perfect score. The audio controls for your Android phone works well, but sadly does nothing in an iPhone.

I am a complete audiophile, but on a budget.<br />The styling of these headphones is out of the ordinary, and I love it. They seem durable so far, but I haven't owned them long enough to know if they truly last long. The carrying case provided is extremely stylish and seems durable. Carrying the headphones in the carrying case is a MUST if you want these headphones to have a long life.<br /><br />I've used Monster DNA headphones for the longest time, thinking that they were the best in ear headphones at this price point. I've owned the same pair for the last two and a half years, and they're still going strong. Granted, one of the plastic covers came off on the headphones, but superglue fixed that problem. The highs and mids of the DNAs are pretty clear, but you could tell that the bass is a little too strong, even for my liking. I enjoy listening to rap and hip hop daily, so I enjoy a overly healthy amount of bass in my audio equipment.<br /><br />After looking into a pair of back-up headphones, I checked these out and ordered a pair. I paid $38 for these, compared to $55 for the DNA's.<br />After seeing the top review for this item, I was excited to see if these headphones would truly &#34;change the way I listened to music&#34;. Well let me tell you... these do just that. The Diesels completely blew me away. I still get chills when I listen to music everyday with these. The mids and highs are clearer than any other headphone I've ever listened to, ever. I've listened to pretty much every other monster headphone, and these are the ones that stick out majorly. Each layer of sound in each song is separated beautifully. You can honestly hear each individual instrument on its own when you listen to country, rock, or any other type of music. When you listen to Hip hop and rap, you can hear each individual component of the song, crystal clear. Let me note on the bass of these headphones too. They aren't overpowering like the DNA's, not even close. In fact, they're dead accurate at reproducing the exact bass note, no matter what music you're listening to. These healthily blend the mids, highs, and lows for the most perfect balance I've ever heard. I've heard parts of songs that I've never heard before with these headphones. I can't believe I got these for $38. I feel like I stole them for that price.<br /><br />My girlfriend listened to these headphones once, and told me how much she loves them. She has a pair of bose headphones, and says that these headphones blew her away. I just ordered her a pair, and am considering ordering myself another pair, in case I lose these.<br /><br />The Monster DNAs are now my back-up headphones. However, I might order another pair of Diesel's as a back-up, and just use the DNA's as a working out headphone. I cannot express how much I love these headphones. Buy these, and they will change the way you listen to music.",2015-08-31

The nuts have some sort of unthreaded plastic in the front end that you can't easily screw the screw into the nut. I almost stripped a couple screws before I just used the screw as a holder and a socket wrench to tighten the nut. This is really the best way.<br /><br />The next challenge was that, unlike some other designs, the mounting plate for the TV does not detach from the mount so you need a small army of people to hold the tv in place for either screwing the whole assembly into the wall or the wall-attached mount to the TV.<br /><br />Last, the mounting plate not detaching from the mount wouldn't have been quite as big of a problem except that... the extension arms didn't quite match up with the holes on the TV. I've used other mounts previously so this was definitely an issue with the design of this product. We did eventually get it to work by loosening the screws between the extension arms and the main plate but that was entirely less than ideal and not made any easier due to nut/screw design for fastening the arms.<br /><br />I liked the mount once I got it up there but do not look forward to having to move it in the future... If you do buy the mount, make sure you have the following:<br />A good socket wrench<br />A team of people to help you install it",2015-08-31

With that said, as the pictures below show, these batteries are in fact in my possession.  They were gifted to me by someone since they knew that we used many electronics that use 18650 batteries.<br /><br />For starters, the flashlights that we chose to test these batteries [refer to Pic 1 & Pic 4] for many days were the [[ASIN:B00IEWOCP0 ThruNite TN12 2014 Edition 1050 Lumen Single CREE XM-L2 U2 LED EDC Flashlight, Neutral White]], and also the NGOA G700 flashlight.  Each of these operate with an 18650 battery.  The Thrunite TN12 is a far better than the NGO, but we wanted to have another reference point to test the batteries.<br /><br />The first pic below shows both flashlights and not only the Foxnovo 3400 batteries, but also:<br /><br />- the rechargeables that came with the NGOA, which is a BRC 18650 4200mAh [claimed]<br />- the [[ASIN:B00ANX46H2 3400mAh 18650 PROTECTED Li-ion Orbtronic Rechargeable Battery - for High Power Flashlights]],<br />- the [[ASIN:B0062ANS7O TWO PROTECTED 3100mAh 18650 (Industrial NCR18650A Panasonic Cell inside) Li-ion Rechargeable Orbtronic Battery Cells- DUAL Protection, Button Top, PCB- High Performance]],<br />- the [[ASIN:B00O8TRYGW Foxnovo ICR18650 2600mAh 3.7v 9.6Wh High Drain IC Protected 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries - 2 Pieces]]<br />- and the [[ASIN:B00F58XW2A NITECORE NL183 3.7V 2300mAh 8.5Wh 18650 Li-ion Battery Rechargeable Lithium High-capacity Battery (Nitecore NL183 Battery) (2*NL183 2300mAh Battery)]]<br /><br />The batteries are shown in pics to shed some light into the fact that not only do we use 18650s in this household, but we've also [over time] gotten a variety of 18650s, be it directly or indirectly.<br /><br />Now, am going to address another review because it might be useful for some folks.  The person mentions that the Foxnovo 18650 3400 were 5mm taller than their other 18650s.  Wish they stated which other battery it was for reference purposes, but that is okay.  From Pic #3 below you can see that although the Foxnovo batteries seem to be a fraction longer than the Orbtronic 3100, although such is not the case with the Orbtronic 3400.  The Foxnovo batteries seem to be just as tall [although it wasn't measured, this is only gathered from the pictures] as the Nitecore 2300.  And ALL the batteries are considerably taller than the BRC 4200s.  This did not affect me personally, as the two flashlights shown and two other types did not have any issues running the 18650 batteries, but it might affect some others depending on the device one uses perhaps.  You can use the picture as a reference in case your device is extremely size dependent.<br /><br />Now to the comparison.  This was not an exhaustive test, but only a preliminary test that takes into account prior experience with batteries, length of times in operation, charging times and such.<br /><br />Am going to start from the worst, to the best for reference.<br /><br />For starters, there is NO POSSIBLE way that the BRC 18650s are 4200 mAh.  Not only is their run time not last as long as neither the Foxnovo or Orbtronic 18650s, but they are more comparable to the Nitecore 2300, if that.  The flashlights also only last on Turbo only about 30 minutes, if that.  Total 3/5 stars [if that!]<br /><br />The Nitecore 2300 mAh came in second worst.  These batteries were not purchased directly, but came indirectly with a Nitecore rechargeable flashlight.  So they were not my first choice in batteries.  With that said, they perform better than the BRCs, last an ample amount of time, haven't had any issues with them, and only now that we have Foxnovo 2600s do we have anything else near the alleged battery potential.  A better comparison might be done in the future.  Total 4/5 stars.<br /><br />Finally, am just going to compare the Foxnovo 18650s, to the Orbtronic 18650s.  All of these batteries performed well in every way shape and form they were used.  Initially, the two lower powered batteries Foxnovo 2600 mAh/ Orbtronic 3100 mAh, were used, and obviously they Orbtronic last longer than the Foxnovo, but it should.  Did not see anything with either battery that did not feel right.  Wish the Foxnovo 3100s had been available, but got a feeling it would not have changed much, as each battery performed extremely well with length of time running, amount of time running on turbo and such.<br /><br />The top tier 3400s for Foxnovo and Orbtronic definitely are in a league of their own.  Orbtronic has basically set the standard with their 18650 batteries, and Foxnovo is RIGHT on their heels.  Something to keep in mind is that the Orbtronics 3100mAh/3400mAh have gone up in price 10-20% since our last purchase, so its good to know that Foxnovo sells something JUST as good, if not better than their counterpart for less.  Both batteries last a heck of a long time, and would trust my life with them.  Having batteries fail me in the past during an emergency has made me the importance of having the right equipment for certain circumstances.  Hands down though [so far that is], the Foxnovo batteries offer a much better value than the Ortronic.  Not only are they better priced [at least as of the date of this review], but they re-charge at least 1000 times when compared to the Orbtronic batteries, which state at least 500 times. Just in case someone is interested, as seen in Pic 5 & 6, the Foxnovo batteries come in a small box, whle the Orbtronic comes in a hard plastic case, which is rather nice considering how long you will own the batteries.  Really wish the Foxnovo batteries came with this type of case in the future, especially given their rated 1000 re-charge cycles.  Each of the Foxnovo and Orbtronic batteries are 5/5 stars in their respective categories.<br /><br />Only time will tell whether the Foxnovo 18650 3400 mAh batteries stand the test of time, and whether or not they will continue to give the Orbtronics a run for their money.<br /><br />Lastly, if you are the type of person that works as a policeman/fireman/emergency personnel/contractor, and NEED your gear to work, and don't mind paying a higher price, the Orbtronic batteries should be pondered.<br /><br />Now, if you want EXTREME value for the price, the Foxnovo 18650 batteries have no competition.  Look forward to more offerings from Foxnovo in the future.",2015-08-31

I had almost pulled the trigger on an Onkyo, but I came across the Yamaha RX-V series. They seemed to be pretty good &#34;bang for your buck&#34; receivers, and it just so happened that Amazon was having a sale on the 677. For the feature set that it had, and the price they were selling it for, it was a no brainer. I hit the buy button and never looked back!<br /><br />I previously had a &#34;1000 watt&#34; RCA Home theater in a box setup that was temporarily powering my new speakers, but it wasn't doing a great job of it. I also couldn't hook all of them up due to it being a 5.1 output but I ran speakers for 7.1. Once I got the Yamaha unit installed I was in for quite the treat. This thing blows my old RCA HTIB receiver out of the water! Outstanding sound, so many features, and it looks fantastic.<br /><br />Initial setup is a breeze, with an intuitive on-screen menu that makes the process as painless as could be. You'll be up and running in no time flat. If you choose to use it, the YPAO auto setup is pretty neat. I went and tweaked the settings a bit more afterwards to get it to my liking. The auto adjustment is a great feature and is a good way to get your settings in the ballpark for further customization. Just make sure the room is nice and quiet while the YPAO program is running. It doesn't take long.<br /><br />The companion app on my phone makes using everything on here a breeze. I use the app over my Harmony Ultimate for sheer ease of use and the feature set. I can tune in to internet radio of all sorts, to include scanner feeds (I'm a volunteer Firefighter/EMT so I enjoy listening to the radio traffic of big cities).  I've never been big on the multitude of DSP settings, but they're there if you want them. The included remote doesn't seem too bad, but I don't use it. Honestly the app does everything I could possibly need it to, and in a more user friendly way.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed and very happy with the performance of this unit. With solid build quality, good looks, and great features, Yamaha has made a happy customer out of me.r /><br />Overall, I am impressed and very happy with the performance of this unit.

The round housing, often called &#34;gamer's earbuds&#34; is the key element in giving big BEWM BEWM bass (thus the appellation &#34;gamers earbuds, 'cuz we like da pew pew BEWM).  However, traditional gamer's earbuds are metal housing, whereas this is lightweight plastic.  This does have the advantage of not having a heavy back-end as metal housing does indeed have a tendency of shifting itself and out.  Yet on the flip side, it has none of the BEWM that metal, or even wood, housing can deliver.<br /><br />There is a wood housing set also sold by SOWND Audio, same round housing style, that actually has much richer, deeper, and pronounced bass response.  [[ASIN:B013DFK3G4 SOWND Audio Premium Genuine Wood In-ear Noise-isolating Headphones with Microphone (Silver)]]<br /><br />The bass on this set still has a bit of punch to it, but it is on the whole subsumed in the rest of the range.  And using the same iOS Virtual EQ that I used on the other pair... did not a thing for this one save tone down the crispy treble.<br /><br />Still, if you don't want overdriven bass, but a more somewhat overbalanced emphasis on the treble side of the force, these may be a good consideration.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.",2015-08-31

I got these off eBay brand new, factory sealed, and like I do with all my headphones, I check the serial # to make sure they are authentic and what do you know, they were.<br /><br />The first thing that caught my eye when I first took these out of the packaging was the build. As I like monster headphones/earphones, and own many sets of both, I've noticed how bad the build quality is with most of the products. Regardless to how most of them sound the plasticy build and flimsiness take away from the overall value. I am happy to report with these, this is not the case. These offer a great build made out of a well structured plastic model. Containing some metal, these are pretty heavy, but won't get uncomfortable on the head. These will defiantly survive a few drops or bends, but don't be to rough with these. Overall I think these have pretty good build quality.<br /><br />Now moving on to comfort. These headphones can be uncomfortable because of the triangle earpads. This didn't reall cause any trouble for me but some people have a hard time fitting their ears I the cups, after all they are over-ear headphones. Even though these feature nice and soft earpads I did notice my ear resting on the speaker a few times. One thing that I found annoying was when the bass kicked in, the headphones vibrated a little which tickled my ears. As absurd as that sounds it's true, I was repositioning the headphones a lot to stop that from happening.<br /><br />Desgin- these things look sick, no questions asked.<br /><br />These headphones do feature some pretty cool things that I haven't mentioned yet. They come with two Female jacks on both the right and left side, in which Monster calls music share enabling you to daisy chain headphones. With that being a pretty cool feature on its on these do also come with pretty good passive noise isolation, which Monsters boasts about on the box. The heapphones do a good job of muffling out sound coming from the world outside the headphones. The last feature worth mentioning is the pure monster sound expirence app. To be honest it's quite and expirence, this app comes with many presets/Artist preset with if you switch on it will change the sound according to what song or genre of music you are listening to. For example if you are listening to hip-hop and you switch the &#34;hip-hop&#34; preset on it's gonna give you a deeper sound which will essentially empansize lower frequency response. I thought that was really cool, you can check out the app on the AppStore free. It is not available for andriod yet unfortunately. One more thing to note is if you have the on ear version, too, like me there is also a space of the app designated to the on ear version.<br /><br />Sound (this is based off the sound without the adjustments from the app) - I really enjoy the sound of these and am still shocked by the sound these things reproduce. When testing with rap music, the bass is way over emphasized in my opinion but the good news is that the bass doesn't distort the mids and highs. The bass is punchy with a nice kick to it, I was shocked that vocals sounded as clear as they did. When you turn things down a notch and just want to chill to some jazz or classic these will do the trick. Instruments sound nice and smoothe with no distortion at top volumes. Like I said these do pack a lot of bass when needed but these aren't just for rap music. These hit highs with great precision and sound great when it comes to other genres of music. Another plus when it comes to these is you don't need an amp or dac to power these, a regular smart phone has enough output to push these to there full potential. Overall the sound on these is great at times the bass is really heavy but with all that the mid range, highs, vocals, and instruments still sound great.<br /><br />I also wanted to pointe out that you can use these with professional audio equipment, if that's what your looking atthese for.<br /><br />If your thinking about getting these don't hesitate. I am not sure why the price is so low for these because they were just showcased CES this year. They normally retail for $300 and as of now they are $120, that's insane. In trying to get to the bottom of this.<br /><br />Overall- Great headphones that offer amazing sound for all types of music.<br /><br />Included in the box:<br /><br />Monster DNA Pro 2.0 Headphones<br />Carry Bag<br />Carabiner Clip<br />Monster Cleaning Cloth<br />1/4 Inch Adapter<br />Control Talk Cable (for Apple)<br />Professional Coil Cable",2015-08-31

The sound is crisp and clear and these make me want to listen to music only with headphones on and to even watch movies and TV shows with them on.<br /><br />They are comfortable both on the ear with soft cushions and on the top of the head due to another soft cushion where they sit on the top of your head. The ear phones fold so they can lie flat and can be stored and carried in the case which has a soft interior with stiff sides (so they do not get crushed) and the case has light padding on the exterior and closes with a zipper.<br /><br />The full functionality is available when using these with Android devices (as is clearly stated by Bose): for a phone call: answer a call, end a call, use voice control; for  media playing: play, pause, skip forward, and skip backward; and increase and decrease volume. These also work for listening with Apple devices but the all the controls do not work on Apple devices (as Bose states). I was able to get the pause to work with iPhone but nothing else. This is not a complaint I am just explaining that they do work to listen and pause on Apple devices.<br /><br />I rate theses 5 stars = I Love It.",2015-08-31

Comfort-wise, it is one of the nicer sets I have ever used, being light weight, yet solid and having good sound quality. The leather ear cuffs are the softest and most comfortable I have felt. They are very nice indeed.  They come in a very nice case with a pocket for the cables.  As a bluetooth headset, it can do calls or media sound wirelessly from your bluetooth-enabled device (smart phone, etc.). As a wired headphone, it can function as a regular set of stereo headphones. In both cases, the audio quality is good - solid bass, clear highs, good isolation and separation, etc. The microphone worked adequately for making these a hands-free phone headset, but does pick up a lot of room noise, at least partly because of its position.  I have a couple of minor nitpicks which should only be worth a half star or so, but I can't rate by half a star, so be aware of that (these are actually more like 4.5 to 4.7 stars). The instructions are pretty mediocre, with some confusing diagrams and not much in the way of clear, full sentences. Now I understand that there are those who like the &#34;challenge&#34; of treating every new piece of gear as an Easter egg hunt, but I am not one of them. I prefer clear, unambiguous explanations of functions and capabilities, and Bose falls pretty short here.  In a $20 piece of gear, I can forgive mediocre instructions - in gear this expensive I expect better. When you find $20 gear with instructions significantly better than over-$100 gear from someone like Bose, that deserves some notice. Remember, the job isn't finished until the paperwork is done.  The other minor nitpick is with the included audio cable (and nice that they included it - no complaint there) - Why the choice of 2.5mm plug on one end (headphone end) and 3.5mm on the other? That is just strange. It means that one can only use the cable in one direction, and one must pay attention to the orientation of the cable when using it. The difference in space taken up by the larger (and far more common) size plug/jack combination is small, and in an item the size of the earpiece, I do not see the need to make such an odd compromise. Not critical, but annoying for no reason (unless the accountant says they need to save a few pennies on each unit - again a bit of silliness on an item this expensive, but understandable if you know accountants of this type).  All in all a great set of bluetooth headphones. For noisy environments, or times when you want to listen to something and not be encumbered by headphone cables, these should work well. If you need (or want) something like this, you should seriously consider these. Definitely very nice headphones.",2015-08-31

They definitely produce a decent sound stage effect that is very comparable to Sennheiser. I mostly recommend them to people who listen to epic trailer music and electronic music like dubstep, but I'm sure they will do great with other genres too.<br /><br />Let's talk about design, I confess that I fell for their look when I bought them, suspecting that they might disappoint me later.

My purpose for writing a review is to, hopefully, help others who will have the same first impression I did:  how do I return this?  Before you act on that thought, I’d ask you to follow some straight-forward advice:<br />1. The first thing to do after taking it out of the box is to install the micro SDHC card and power it up in your car. Don’t do what I did and connect it to your PC via the USB cord expecting that it can be customized by doing this.  The USB connection is only useful if you want to transfer the SDHC card files to your PC without having to extract the micro SDHC card.<br />2. Stick it on the windshield having only powered it up with the card installed. Drive around for a few miles to get a decent sample of the recording and then transfer the recording to your PC to review what the default settings give you.<br />3. Then, in your car, you can try alternative settings to see which ones you like best.<br /><br />Note that the Parking Mode and Motion Detection options are incompatible with the normal use while driving. When selected, the camera doesn’t automatically go into the drive mode and will result in the on/off cycling that others have commented on.<br /><br />Having said this, I’d recommend the camera to friends. The picture is high resolution and the 170 degree field of view is quite adequate. Four instead of five stars is only based on the lack of some plain language instructions being included. Hopefully you will be as happy with the camera as I am. If it holds up for a year or more, I’d say my $55 investment was well worth it.",2015-08-31

The 650 is very easy to program using the application you can install on your PC. I have it successfully controlling my Intel NUC with Kodi installed, Denon Receiver, Samsung TV and my PS3. The PS3 is bluetooth only so I had to buy the adapter. It converts an IR signal to bluetooth. The wife is also happy with this remote as it makes it so much easier for her to watch whatever she wants.If you are interested in the PS3 adapter it is sold here on Amazon. Look up &#34;Logitech Harmony Adapter for Playstation 3,&#34; and it should pull up. Its nice because you really just need one remote for all of your equipment. Now I can watch anything I want with a touch of a button. I dont think you can beat this product at this price point. They also have an active user forum on Logitech's website for support issues.  All in all a solid product and I highly recommend it.",2015-08-31

There is a specific power cycle pattern to be followed in order to get the AV receiver set up screen on to the TV.I am able to connect a Laptop to the HDMI of the TV and it works. I think Yamaha and Sony has to work together to resolve this issue other wise they may loose their customers.I am seeing some of the forums already started discussing this issues.  Step 1:unplug the TV Step 2: Wait for couple of seconds (looks wired .) Step 3: Turn on XBR65X850C Step 4: Go to settings and select HDMI4/ARC input Step 4: Turn ON the Yamaha RX-A750 Step 5: You will see the Piano screen on to the TV  In any case do not turn off the AV receiver .As long as u dont turn off you wull get the AV output on to TV. if you turn off the AV receiver then u have to repeat the above steps once again  Note: Turning off the TV remote is not sufficient .

I've bought cheaper headphones before where when the you run and bounce, and the cord slaps on your back, it transmits some bass into the headphones.  These Senbowe have the worst of this effect I've ever heard.  It's so bad it actually dwarfs the music.<br /><br />(2) Thick cheap cord - the cord is heavy and thick.  It doesn't lay evenly across your neck - half of it hangs in the air awkwardly because it's so thick and stiff.<br /><br />(3)  Very uncomfortable earpieces.  These are the cheapest rubber I've seen in earbuds among the dozen or so I've bought from Amazon.  They will stay in your ears - at the exchange of comfort.<br /><br />I have to return these given how crazy loud the noise they make when you jog.",2015-08-30

We don't watch a lot of TV anyway so this antenna lets us watch football games, news, and Sesame Street without a high price tag. Occasionally a station won't come in that well so we just move the antenna around and can usually find a sweet spot where it will work.

Bluetooth pairing was a breeze, and I loved the fact you can do everything with 3 buttons -- didn't need to look at the device a single time in that whole week since I could do everything just by tact.  This was a huge plus for me.  It's also incredibly portable, just a little fatter than a thick cell phone case and grippy enough to carry in one hand.  If you like turtles, you'll like this cute little box.  However...<br /><br />I tested it out-of-the-box, and connectivity wasn't the best -- at times sound would cut out and it wouldn't be as clear as it could have.  Sound issues were mostly resolved after a full charge, but the Bluetooth range wasn't as good as advertised, much less so when there were walls or even minor obstructions between the device and the turtle.  I would have easily overlooked these issues if the speaker's max volume had been louder.  It's really nice that it's sensitive and the volume is very gradual (great for night-time jams), but another 10 or so points of volume would have made me keep it.  To be fair, the speaker is small, and I'd be playing it in the car with the window down.  I thought the speaker volume was adequate inside a room.  But I didn't buy the speaker for my room, I bought it to bring with me on my adventures, for which unfortunately it wasn't loud enough.  I was sad to return it :(",2015-08-30

Buy one of these, instead ...","I purchased this antenna without realizing it was an &#34;amplified&#34; antenna until after the purchase. If I had noticed it at first, I wouldn't have ordered it.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />Amplifiers on TV antennas don't significantly improve the capability for you to view a TV channel. Sure, you will probably see a stronger &#34;Signal Strength&#34; for all your channels. Maybe you will even see more channels listed (I didn't). But, the important thing is being able to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) - which boosts your TV signal without raising the background noise level at the same time. I haven't found an inexpensive TV antenna amplifier yet that does this. All the TV antenna amplifiers I have used (including this one) have all boosted the noise and the signal at the same time, and the amplified channels are still as unwatchable as when they are unamplified.<br /><br />Think about it this way: If this simple amplification would improve the TV reception for all channels, why don't they put this amplification in all HDTVs? (Note: There is some signal amplification and heavy signal processing done in all HDTVs to extract the TV signal, but the real work is done by the signal processing)<br /><br />Here's a good example: I live 25 miles from the transmitting towers for my metro area. Even with using the amplification, I only picked up 34 channels with the 1byone. My recommended antenna (below) gets 45 channels unamplified. Both antennas were pointed in the same direction by using my compass.<br /><br />In summary: This &#34;60 Mile Antenna&#34; amplified 1byone antenna is a cheaper antenna attached to an amplifier to compensate, and certainly isn't usable as a realistic 60 mile antenna.<br /><br />Now, to the antennas I DO recommend, sold by Amazon. These directional, unamplified antennas by Antennas Direct did a much better job for me:<br /><br />http://amzn.com/B0017O3UHI (UHF Only)<br />http://amzn.com/B007RH5GZI (VHF + UHF)<br /><br />You will want to check in your area to see if you have VHF HD channel broadcasts. While most HDTV channels are broadcast via UHF frequencies, some are broadcast over VHF frequencies. In my metro area, there are two major broadcasters that use VHF. That will determine which of the two antennas above you should consider buying.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Antennas Direct antennas are a bit more expensive, but this is a one-time purchase, so I'm OK with that.want to check in your area to see if you have VHF HD channel broadcasts.

Wanted something better than what get out of the PC headphone plug output to a pair of Presonus nearfield reference speakers.  Reviews on the MF V90 were very encouraging.  Seems like something can also use to  experiment with sending PC streaming to my main system (Naim preamp/amp).  Can then decide whether to spend a lot more for a DAC.  The sound quality of the MF V90 is every bit an improvement worth the money, especially since bought it used.

My admittedly snooty impression when reading them is usually something along the lines of: “Well, this person’s clearly an idiot and just doesn’t know what they’re doing.” Congrats to Personus for making me the idiot in this case.<br /><br />If I had to guess, these were speakers conceived of by a marketing group and then rushed through development without giving much thought to technical design and testing. As you can glean from the numerous negative reviews on Amazon (and elsewhere), these speakers do have serious deficiencies that, to make matters worse, Presonus seems to be handling by inventing plausible deniability for themselves instead of actually attempting to address the issues (more on that below). Trust me when I say my criticisms are not just a matter of having “sour grape” syndrome. These things really do have problems.<br /><br />Presonus’ primary marketing claims for these speakers are: 1) that they offer Bluetooth connectivity; and 2) that the sound quality is good (not “audiophile” good, just run-of-the-mill good, which you would think should be relatively achievable). In my opinion, they fall short on both claims. To wit...<br /><br />1) Bluetooth connectivity – If you’re reading this review, you’ve probably noticed that the majority of other negative reviews comment on “static” and/or “hiss” coming from the speakers when attempting to play music via Bluetooth connection. Prior to giving these speakers a shot, I figured these reviews were flukes, i.e., either said reviewer had the rare defective speaker or the problem could be attributed to user error. My suspicion about these speakers was raised a little bit when I read one reviewer commenting that he discovered the static sound (identical to the sound accompanying “snow” on a TV) was caused by the powered speaker (i.e., the left one) being plugged into an ungrounded, two-wire outlet. “That seems plausible,” I thought, but I decided to give them a try anyway. Unfortunately, after having tried these speakers in both grounded and ungrounded outlets, I can now verify that this is exactly the case. Simply put: if you intend to plug these speakers into an outlet that is ungrounded (i.e., having no third hole for a ground circuit), playback of music will be overlain by severe static, so much so that you probably won’t hear any identifiable musical sounds coming from the speakers. Because I had a non-Presonus subwoofer connected to the speakers when I tested this, I can confirm that you will still be able to connect to the speakers via Bluetooth (I heard rhythmic bass coming from the subwoofer, which suggests that the music signal was streaming), but you simply won’t be able to hear much, if anything, other than static (and a little bass if using a subwoofer). As long as the place where you intend to use these speakers has grounded outlets, the Bluetooth connection should work without producing static (at least in my case it did), but if your home was built prior to about 1965 and has not had a wiring upgrade, these won’t work for you if you intend to use them with Bluetooth (which is the main selling point of these speakers).<br /><br />Presonus makes matters worse (for its own reputation, I think) when on its website it attempts to sweep this problem under the rug by attributing the “static” problem to mere user error. Specifically, if you read the “troubleshooting” section for the Ceres line, Presonus talks its way around the issue by arguing that static and hiss may be the result of poor audio source quality (e.g., crummy MP3 files, a laptop with cheap audio adapters, etc.). Now, while it’s certainly possible to get his and static from a lackluster audio source, that’s not the source of the problem being widely reported in these reviews – it’s the problem associated with plugging them into ungrounded outlets. Surely Presonus knows this, which makes their irrelevant response to the problem look like little more than an attempt to generate plausible deniability. They would have been just as well off if they had simply stated: “It’s not us; it’s you.”<br /><br />Another note on the Bluetooth connection: I was able to connect with Bluetooth-capable IOS devices (iPhone 5, iPad, etc.), but not with the Bluetooth connection on a Windows 7 laptop. The laptop was able to detect the Ceres speakers, but it wouldn’t stream music due to what was reported as a missing device driver. This could be blamed on Windows (and I’m sure that would be Presonus’ answer), but you would think that a company would go out of its way to make sure its devices worked with the peripherals it claims are supported. Reading Presonus’ technical support for Windows 7 also deserves criticism, as it was nothing more than a cut-and-paste job from what appears to be the troubleshooting steps for a different version of Windows (e.g., Vista, XP, etc.), as the steps in this case didn’t actually match up with the menu configuration for Windows 7. That’s just lazy technical writing. I have no experience calling Presonus’ technical help number (I repackaged and returned these tout suite), but based on the universal criticism it receives, I’m guessing the same people running the tech help line are also writing the tech help documentation.<br /><br />2) Sound quality – These aren’t marketed as “audiophile” speakers, so there’s not much to criticize in terms of sound quality given that Presonus has already set such a low bar for itself. That said, the performance of these speakers was shockingly laughable. I mean, I was irritated at first, but then that sense of irritation was replaced by a kind of existential, “all of life is folly” laughter. The problem? These things are underwhelmingly loud. Disappointingly quiet, you could say. That $20 pair of USB-powered Logitech speakers you saw at Walmart? Yeah, those are louder than these. Again, Presonus claims that one needs to first tweak the volume on the audio source (e.g., iPhone, laptop, etc.) to find the best volume setting on the speakers, but even at its best, the Ceres can only be turned up to about 70 percent its maximum volume range before the speakers begin to clip and the sound breaks up into distortion. Using a decibel meter at a distance of 10 feet, I could only get about 75 decibels at the maximum volume setting before clipping. For reference, that’s about how loud a dishwasher is. Given this limitation, I think these speakers would be perfect for either streaming Raffi music in the nap room of a daycare or playing wildlife sounds in a cat sanctuary. If that’s your thing, these speakers are for you (provided, of course, the problems with the Bluetooth connection described above don't already present an impediment).<br /><br />Some other annoyances... The subwoofer out connection is a 1/4” TRS jack, whereas most consumer-grade subwoofers are equipped with RCA-style connections. That means you’ll probably need an adapter to run an existing subwoofer from these speakers. Presonus includes a 1/4&#34;-to-RCA adapter as an accessory, but for some reason it’s a 1/4&#34; mono adapter, not a TRS (i.e., stereo) adapter, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a TRS-equipped subwoofer out. Again, poor planning on Presonus’ part.<br /><br />While Bluetooth-equipped speakers are clearly more than a gimmick (as evidenced by the numerous other BT-equipped audio products on the market), Presonus’ execution with the Ceres makes at least their version of it look pretty gimmicky. I guess my first clue to this should have been the fact that their product video for the Ceres line doesn’t actually give any useful information about the speakers, themselves, but instead shows a group of what I’m assuming are trust-funded, twenty-something hipsters playing horribly clich&eacute;d music and slicing up a cucumber (seriously). In short, you can, and should, do far better for the money.USB-powered Logitech speakers you saw at Walmart? Yeah, those are louder than these.

First of all it has excellent stability including copnnecting to Airplay, net radio, bluetooth and every device Ive thrown at it. After having a Denon that was quirky, glitchy and unstable all the time  I'm super happy with this. Denon should exit the market until they get fully functional stable products. The yamaha updated nicely when updating the software.<br />The control app is smooth works well and intuitively. Both the app and the onscreen display are helpful with ease of use for all zones. The amplifiers work well with excellent sound quality. I formerly bought high end Denon (and I mean never again) that dont sound as clear and uncolored as these amplifiers. So all in all its a thrill to use with great software. The ability to adjust sound programs, tone or go direct via remote app is actually useful and fun to adjust for old recordsing and the like.,",2015-08-30

Otherwise, it just really mutes noises.<br />I cannot overstate the value of having the extension cord unplug from *both* ends -- I've walked away from my computer before and forgot to take off my headphones and it just unplugs from the headphone side instead of ripping the wire out like on other headphones.

This is a 9 month update on our purchase of the MiPow Bluetooth Wireless LED Playbulb. We have had ample time to use this product in many areas and fascists of our daily family life.<br /><br />Replacing the Playbulb with our normal LED light bulb from our deck light, we then enjoy music from our tablets out on the deck during a nice spring or summer day. As well as enjoying music while we are doing our gardening. The Playbulb is plenty loud enough to be heard all over the deck and into the garden. But not loud enough that the neighbors can hear it or complain about it. This will not rock the house down if that is what you are looking for. But if you are looking for something like background music level from say a waiting room, yet a tad louder. Than this Playbulb works out well. The light is a bright white, not a yellow white, and we had almost no bug activity around the LED light at night. Over all, this Playbulb has worked well as our out door bluetooth source for music.<br /><br />Replacing the Playbulb with our normal LED light bulb from the bathroom. Well lets just say the wife no longer takes 20 minute baths, she now takes two hour baths almost. As she will get lost in her music while soaking in her lavender tub. The music is plenty loud enough for a bathroom due to all the reflective properties found within the room. Loud enough that I can hear it at times down the hall in the bedroom even with the bathroom door closed. In a small space, and a highly reflective place, the Playbulb comes through in good sound quality. Again, this is not going to rock the house down. The white of the LED light can be a bit bright in the bathroom, especially because the light hangs in front of the mirror. We normally prefer the yellow LED light as it is softer on our eyes, but to each their own.<br /><br />Replacing the Playbulb with our normal LED light bulbs from either our bedroom or the daughters. In both rooms the sound was good being they were being a material lamp shade which can absorb the sound. They sound like a good clock radio that one might play in their bedroom to give an idea of the sound level and quality. Like the other locations, the Playbulb will not rock the house down. But in the bedroom, I would recommend two Playbulbs, one for each side of the bed. For having them in stereo they would produce a much better sound quality that evenly distributes itself throughout the room. Being the bedrooms are bigger than the bathroom, and less reflective. The Playbulb is not as loud in the bedroom compared to the bathroom. But this can be solved by using two Playbulbs.<br /><br />We were not paid nor discounted in any way, shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others. We believe, as a family, it is important to give an honest and accurate review to assist others so they can make good purchasing decisions that can benefit them and their family.

We recently got a mini projector and needed an HDMI cable for it to connect from the projector to our extra Roku. The cable feels very well-made and the adapters feel like they are pretty secure when added onto the cable. It's a good length cable at 5 feet so there's plenty of room to play with.<br /><br />When we tried it out, as mentioned earlier, we used it with our mini projector that we recently purchased. It was easy to connect both projector and Roku to the cable. Our Roku is set at 1080p and the projector was able to project the image at 1080p onto the wall. The image produced was clear and surpassed our expectations. We moved the cables around a little while running it to be sure they stayed secure and stayed in place and there were no interruptions which, to me, indicates it's a good cable. The adapters are a great addition to this cable since many different devices use different methods of connecting. Because we now have them on hand, we know we will be prepared if needed. This cable can also be used for many other things, such as, game consoles, computers, and other electronics. Overall, I'm very happy we got this HDMI cable. It has worked out perfectly for our needs and we plan to make this our go-to HDMI cable now that we will be using our projector often.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount so that I may test it out and write an honest, unbiased product review.

They come very, very close to my Audioquest Sydney cables, which go for something like $160. The reason I didn't give them five stars is because of the defective cables I received and the fact that the RCA plugs fit very loosely, they pull out very easily if you even touch the cable.

Clear mid-range but I personally didn't feel the bass was that great.  But then again the price is very reasonable. It doesn't compare to my Bose Soundlink bass-wise but it's one-third the price so it should not be compared to it.  It does get loud.  I really appreciate the size.  I take it to work with my iPad since it sounds so much better than the cheap boom-box they provided.  I put it in my lunch bag and it fits.  One thing and it has nothing to do with this review.  The outside packing box was in good shape but the plastic packaging around the speaker was shattered and the speaker had scuff marks all over it.  They did come off with some rubbing with a cloth but what the heck happened?  The speaker really took a beating and still worked properly.  It paired up so easy.

The product worked great for just over a year when it began to display different and ever changing charging data and would no-longer charge the batteries.  At first I thought it may be the batteries, but after buying several sets of good batteries, I determined that the La Crosse BC1000 was defective and would no longer charge any size of batteries.  I checked the La Crosse’s web site only to find out that the warranty was one (1) year from the date of purchase, which is just a little less than a year if you figure in the order/delivery time.<br /><br />LaCrosse Technology has some very excellent product ideas, but I have found that the durability/quality of their products is lacking.  If they would only spend a very small percentage more to give their products the quality and durability required for customer satisfaction, I believe that their sales would increase dramatically. Expect less than two years of service from this product, if you take care of it by unplugging it whenever it is not in use, use a surge protector and clean it.

Use US appliances overseas,Electronics,4,2,2,N,N,Connecting this converter to an electronic device? Don't even think about it!,"The product description is incorrect. This converter is NOT appropriate for electronic devices: They can be destroyed in a fraction of a second. At the heart of the converter is a solid state device called a thyristor. It is a type of electronic switch. It's about 1/2&#34; square and about 1/8&#34; thick and weighs almost nothing. It doesn't require an iron-core transformer, so the converter is very compact and light. The thyristor switchs the 220 V on for a fraction of the 50 Hz cycle so that the AVERAGE power into a resistive load, such as a toaster, waffle iron, or hair curler...in short, any device whose function is to produce heat...will be the same as from 110 V. The key word here is average. The MAXIMUM (PEAK) voltage coming out of the converter is the same as if the appliance were connected directly to 220 V. That's why electronics, which, unlike heaters, respond essentially instantly to the supplied voltage, will be &#34;burned out&#34; when used with this type of converter. For electronics, one needs a transformer. Sorry about that, but transformers are heavy, and the more power you need, the heavier it's going to be. A 1600 W transformer may weigh 10 lbs.",2015-08-30

I was looking for a simple, very small, lightweight, large capacity, durable MP3 player with great battery life and a color screen with a customizable user interface. I postponed my purchase for weeks until I found this unit on Amazon. This product met every single requirement. I clip this to the front of my shirt and plug in the premium quality ear buds included with the unit and forget that it's there. It is so lightweight and full featured that you are only wasting time looking for anything better. The Sandisk website offers updates to the firmware inside and gives you more features and current software at no additional charge after purchase. The Sandisk brand, most notably found in many high end devices are known for their quality memory storage and was the final step in my decision to purchase. Don't waste your time looking for anything comparable in this price margin, just buy it. You will love it as much as I did.",2015-08-30

Had I paid the list price ($179) I would not have the same high opinion. For very inexpensive speakers you're going to be hard pressed to find better in the under $100 category. With a sub these will do pretty well as mains in a small to mid sized space. Even without a sub the bass is surprisingly present for speakers this small. As surrounds these are even better and again, at the sale price, a pretty strong value. My main beef is with the cheap/ chintzy black fake-wood veneer cabinets - they look and feel like cheap junk. Guaranteed that they won't hold up to much abuse or handling. But then, most folks will probably hang these on a wall...Still... Point remains, they look and feel like a 50-75 dollar pair of speakers, albeit one that sounds pretty good. In closing I'd like to add that while these are worthwhile budget speakers they are not anything like the speakers carrying the JBL name from the 90s on back. Not even close.",2015-08-30

I'm surprised Noontec is not as well known as some other more common &#34;household&#34; headphone names.  So far everything I have tested from Noontec had a consistent quality, and they don't just look good but also sound great.  Rio S is not an exception, and I would like to share with you more about what I found.<br /><br />Arrived in a premium packaging, my only comment about the cover art is a picture of the guy with headphones.  Similar to Hammo S where they used a male model, I assume the Noontec wants to make a point these headphones are &#34;designed in Italy&#34;, thus have a sense of fashion.  But in my opinion, using people wearing their headphones, especially small in-ear monitors, takes away the focus from the product.  I would prefer to have just a picture of Rio S on the cover, similar to how they did with Zoro II HD.  The back of the packaging has images of all 4 available colors, and the front has a magnetic flip cover with a detailed description of the design and the functionality on the inside.<br /><br />Out of the box you will find a pair of Rio S headphones, a nice compact zippered case, and 4 pairs of hybrid silicon eartips.  It's always nice to see a hard shell case included with headphones instead of a flimsy pouch.  Regarding silicone tips, I assume it should be in 4 different sizes corresponding to L/M/S/XS, though I noticed that both of my small tips were nearly identical in size.  Either way, these are higher quality eartips and the core is colored according to the color of headphones - a perfect match.  I'm just guessing that other Rio S headphone colors probably come with matching eartips.  Also, shirt clip was included.<br /><br />Now, on to a design to check out if they stand up to &#34;fashion hi-fi&#34; label.  Starting with a headphone plug you will find a gold plated connector with a slim plastic housing and a nice strain relief.  The cable is flat, noodle style, with a slightly &#34;sticky&#34; rubbery texture.  Flat cable usually helps with cable management to keep it tangle free and easy to wrap for storage, and also helps with microphonics to reduce the noise of cable rubbing against your cloth.  Shirt clip can assist in that as well, though I rarely see anybody use a shirt clip nowadays.  Y-cable splitter is short and flat, matching the overall shape of the cable, and it doesn't have any strain relief which would have been a good idea on the common side of the cable.  On the splitter side I was surprised to find a chin-slider, not really necessary with a cable that has in-line remote because you can't slide it all the way up, but in this case a chin-slider (moved slightly up) works like a strain relief, helping to create a bigger bend radius.<br /><br />The right side of the cable has in-line remote with a single multi-function button and a mic pinhole on the opposite side.  In-line remote shape flows nicely with the rest of the design, following slim/flat/rectangular theme.  It was a good idea to include a single button universal remote which should work with majority of Android phones and iPhone (don't have iPhone to test, through).  I had no issues using it with my Galaxy S5 and Note 4, and was able to control playback with single click Play/Pause and Call, and track skipping with multi-clicks, and starting Google Now with long press.  Using built in mic during phone calls yielded excellent results with crystal clear sound quality.<br /><br />Moving up the cable closer to earpieces, you will find metal accent buckle with Rio logo.  It's just a &#34;fashion&#34; detail without adding too much distraction or extra weight, a nice touch.  Attached to earpieces, cable goes through a plastic strain relief sleeve which has L/R marking on the inner side to distinguish otherwise symmetrical earpiece design.  Personally, I'm using in-line remote side to ID the Right earpiece so there is no need to even look at the marking.  The actual shape of the shell has nice ergonomics with a nearly flush design that doesn't stick out of your ears and the inner part that comfortable fits inside of your ear canal without going too deep.  There is an air-vent pinhole at the bottom of the nozzle and a nice logo plate on the back.  I do have to mention that from a distance someone could mistake them for a new &#34;beats&#34; in-ears, but closer look clears it up - they definitely have a distinct design.  Also, I was able to wear these wire down and wire up, no difference in sound quality, but wire up made a fitment more secure especially when you use them during exercising.<br /><br />When it comes to a sound tuning, Noontec stayed on a safer side without too much of aggressive bass or too much of analytical harsh brightness.  Rio S has a very balanced smooth detailed sound signature.  Just a perfect tuning to work with any music style.  Sound is very clean, not too bright or too muddy, great for extended listening without worrying about ear fatigue.  Bass has a great quality, rather than boosted quantity.  Soundstage has an intimate feeling with an average depth and width, and it sounds good from any source without a need for an amp or EQ.<br /><br />In more details, low end has more focus on mid bass punch, but still extends down to sub-bass, though it doesn't go too deep.  Mid bass is not necessary very fast, but it's still got a nice speed, just not a very sharp attack.  There is a little bit of bleed into lower mids, but it's not too bad since mids are already smooth and warm.  Lower mids have a nice warmth that adds to organic body of the sound, upper mids are very clean and clear, and at the same time smooth without any harsh peaks.  Treble extension is excellent with a great definition and clarity without even a hint of sibilance.<br /><br />Summary.<br /><br />There are so many headphone manufacturers who focus on fashionable design with flashy colors and exotic earpiece shapes (often, not even comfortable to wear).  But when you start listening to these headphones, you quickly realize they are using generic off-the-shelf drivers that doesn't sound too good.  Sound tuning is a very important part of the design, and Noontec own Votrik driver delivers a true hi-fi performance.  It has a specific sound signature that works with any music style and a pleasure to listen to for an extended time period.  Combined with a great ergonomics of comfortable fitment, it's also a pleasure to use for an extended time period, either if you are relaxing at home or exercising at the gym.  If you get a chance, definitely check them up - for sure, they sound as good as they look!",2015-08-30

Apps also consume data storage, as does the operating system of the phone itself which is a fractious amalgamation of Samsung's Touchwiz and Google's Android).  Samsung has come a long way from yesteryears, when its phones were unappealing plastic bricks. Its efforts to create more premium looking devices is evident in this latest Note. The Note 5 is the slimmest and most attractive yet of the line, with a glass back, powerful camera and a redesigned stylus. Packing a 16 megapixel camera which is capable of live YouTube streaming, new users will be impressed by its social media credentials. The front facing camera is a selfie-lover's dream, having attained 5 megapixels; a notable increase from the prior model's 3.9 megapixels. By far my favorite new feature is the ability to jot notes on the phone screen while it remains turned off. And proximity charging is a cool, if not head-turning feature. The speaker is now at the bottom of the phone, correcting last year's monumental mistake that found the Note 4's speaker on its back, muffling output. The Note 5 maintains the respectable 2,560 x1,440-pixel resolution of last year. It ships with Android 5.1 Lollipop - a nod and salute to Google's juvenile notion of naming an operating system after teeth-corroding appetizers - and will be eligible for an upgrade when Android 6.0 Marshmallow makes its debut. Samsung's Touchwiz mercifully has a very light footprint here.  But Samsung eliminated some of the Note's most distinguishing features. These features were so key that I am returning this latest iteration, and renewing my relationship with my trusty old Note 4. One reason why I originally embraced the Note line was because of its large battery. I am a road warrior, and I needed an Amazonian who could match me step for step. The Note line was renowned for their battery capacity which were increased with each new release. Even in the electronic world, or perhaps particularly in the electronic world, size does matter. This time, not only has Samsung reduced the battery capacity, it has also towed Apple's line, and sealed the battery in the phone, such that it cannot be removed. No more swapping out batteries when I am travelling, or when it weakens from multiple charging cycles. The older Notes also came with an IR blaster, necessary for using the phone as a remote controller. All of my appliances can be turned on with my Note 4. Useful for when the remote control decides to play hide and seek, usually at the most inopportune times. The IR blaster has been eliminated in the Note 5.  Gone also is the expandable slot. Users must now think carefully about how much media they plan on handling with the phone before purchasing because storage can no longer be increased. Going from 32GB to 64GB will cost the average consumer about $100 more. And all this for a narrower, slimmer profile and a glass back that may not survive Galileo's gravity test.  In a nutshell: The Note 5 is an unworthy successor to last year's Note 4, and represents a step in the wrong direction. I will hold out for 2016 which will surely bring us the Note 6, if not one Donald Trump for President. Eliminating choices for consumers and issuing a positive press release was ever an audacious move. The stylus is now the only real difference between the iPhone Plus and the Note. It will forever remain a head-scratcher to find companies attempting to eliminate competition by aping the products that they are competing with. Rather than distinguishing their products even more.",2015-08-30

I pointed it at the local mountain with all the antennas on top of it and bam, it was all good. There is still 1 local channel I don't get but this antenna is by far the best one I've tried so far and I don't really care much about that one channel. I read about all the problems people have had with the rotor but personally, I don't plan on messing with the rotor at all.

I have tried charging and discharging the battery and anything else I could think of.  I tried comnecting to it with multiple different devices via blue tooth and multiple different cords that were known good.  The distortion was not caused by blowing the speakers either.  Over time it seems as if the internal amp has a failure.  Neither unit was even used near the water or a damp environment.  It was used outside while working on small projects.  The battery life was great and I talked many of my friends and family into purchasing the same unit (now with regret).  You will love it and then hate it.

It might be magic but very irritating -- it works like a pointer, or a mouse pointer.  You have to wiggle the remote all the time to get the scroll/mouse arrow -- that is, you have to point it at the screen and wiggle, wiggle, wiggle to get the arrow to appear and then you point the remote around and the arrow moves with your movement, then when over your target you press the center wheel down, it acts as a scrolling wheel as well as a command button, just like on a mouse wheel.  But, if you stop to read something on the screen, like an instruction or a discription of the program you want to choose the command arrow disappears and you are back to wiggle, wiggle, wiggle to get it back and then try to get back on to your target.  If you hit the button wheel, under certain situations and the arrow pops up it may activate the nearest target whether that is what you are after or not.  I hate the damned thing, and wish I could get it back to the conventional point and shot remote.  I know this is supposed to be designed to use like a mouse but it is slow in responding when you want it and it goes off in just a couple of seconds so if you are not constantly in motion you have to keep waking it up and this gets tedious when you are trying to navigate something like Amazon Video or Netflix.  Had I know this was part of the TV I purchased I would not have bought the TV,  It is in a spare room so I don't use it as much as my other Smart TV with the conventional remote, and love it, great 3D.  Don't know what I will do if the built in connection in the other smart TV for the magic remote ever fails?  This typs of remote does not use the external dongal, as it is connect wireless to the TV.  I would only buy this remote as a back up just in case the one I have gets broken by accidently bouncing off the wall.  Peace, Dan",2015-08-30

Perfectly covets your laptops HDMI output to a TV with VGA and audio inputs. I bought this from other online retailer for about the same price.  (NOTE: if you want audio with your VGA output you have to use a 3.5mm male to 3.5 male audio cable to connect from the adapter to the TV/audio receiver)  Users for this adapter: Connect your newer ultrabook/laptop HDMI output to an older TV with VGA and Audio Inputs Connect your HDMI output to a newer HDTV that has no more HDMI inputs available Connect your DVD player to a monitor with no HDMI inputs (Note: you probably won't get audio on the monitor because it won't have speakers) Connect your XBOX to an old tv or monitor Extract an audio signal from your HDMI output to send audio signal to stereo or receiver Convert HDMI output to VGA than use a VGA to DVI  or RCA or SVideo adapter to connect all sorts of components.  I have used many StatTech components over the years and think they are well made and inexpensive.  Great alternative to $50 in store brands.  I recommend this adapter.,2015-08-30

I've always been a fan of Polk speakers.  First fell in love with their sound about 20 years ago when I purchased my first pair (I think the RT900s) when I was 14.  Never really bothered with GOOD PC speakers because most of the time I had a good home theater or nice Bluetooth speaker setup in kitchen/bedroom.  Lately though I've spent more time listening to music on my PC so I thought I'd finally make the jump.  My trusty 16 dollar logitech speakers while for the price worked great, were in need of a decent upgrade.  After much online research I settled on these speakers because I've always loved the brand and they came highly praised by a few good online review sites.<br /><br />Taking notes from other reviews I made sure to place these on a sturdy surface, away from the wall, so the bass response would be accurate, and I also played them for a while to properly break them in.<br /><br />I deducted a star from them because while they sound suburb (a touch bass heavy, but the highs are super crisp) they have a few little flaws.  One being how they timeout.  Now on PC you want to hook them up via USB so that they take advantage of their own built in DAC. While they are hooked up this way if you aren't using them they timeout after 20mins, so if you then go to play music or other sounds, it takes a few seconds to kick back on.  Pretty annoying if you're wanting to control the sound right away and you can't.  Also when they are hooked up via usb you want to have your pc sound levels left at 100 percent, and then use the speakers to adjust the volume.<br /><br />Really though this is the only flaw for me, they sound great, look beautiful, and can easily fill my computer area, and living room/kitchen with clear wonderful sounds.  In fact they sound so crisp and clear, I now have to go through and upgrade my mp3 collection and instead use FLAC.  FLAC files sound amazing compared to mp3s.  I don't think i would have been happy at their full $400 retail price, but at around $280 I feel as if they are worth it.  Just be prepared to re-rip your CD collection into FLAC or something with better compression than mp3  (or whatever itunes uses)<br /><br />Also streaming Pandora via bluetooth on my cellphone sounds and works great as well.",2015-08-30

US,19999618,RBT97LSHP3EY9,B00I4WRVVC,207623372,Silver Ticket 4K Ultra HD Ready Cinema Format (6 Piece Fixed Frame) Projector Screen,Electronics,4,5,6,N,Y,Great Screen that needs a couple little refinements.,"STR-169150 Silver Ticket 150&#34; Diagonal 16:9 HDTV (6 Piece Fixed Frame) Projector Screen White Material<br />This is a very good screen and I am very happy with the way it looks and picture quality with my projector. There are a couple things that could be an improvement.<br />The box showed up in pretty bad shape with one end ripped open. Fortunately everything inside was packed well and nothing was missing or damaged<br />The screen assembled fairly easy. The instructions were a little dark and hard to see. I went to the web site to watch the video but when I clicked on the video link it just kept directing me to an FAQ area.<br />The frame went together easily with the exception of one screw that held together the long sections. The hole did not align well with the threaded hole, I had to force it in and luckily I caught the threads correctly.I did not want to enlarge the hole as a tight fit is what holds the seam as close as possible.<br />I unrolled the screen and inserted the screen mounting rods. The long section of the screen requires you attach two rods together. One rod has a tube crimped onto it and you slide the other rod into the crimped tube. During the initial placement of the rods into the screen edges everything was working fine.<br />The best tip I can give for stretching the screen into place is to do one short side, then the other short side. It takes some pulling but both short sides attached easily and the plastic pins that hold the screen seem adequate. But the problem was that during the stretching as the screen expands the long two piece rods slid out of the connector tube that holds them together. These rods need to screw together instead of merely sliding into each other, they need to change this. We were able to get one rod set to slide back together easily while inserted in the screen, but the other rod set had an issue. The tube that was crimped on one rod was loose and moving on the rod. Every time we tried to slide the rod into the hole it just slid further away until it was completely on one rod. We had to dissemble the screen, remove the rods with the problem, crimp the tube onto the rod more securely and start the the screen install again. The second time the rods came apart again during stretching but were were able to get them back in and finish attaching the two long sections of screen. They will stretch and attach easily if you did the two short sections first.<br /> Next was the center support bar. I had read horror stories about this bar and ripping the screen during installation. The bar went in easily without any marks to the screen. It did require a little hard pushing, but went in smoothly without dragging or catching on anything.I am not sure what is happening during others installs that would rip the screen.<br />Once fully assembled it was time to hang it on the wall. Let me say I hate the mounting method. The four clips that slide in the back of the frame have the large screw head insertion hole and the it it slides down on the screw to hold it in place. The problem with this type of mount is that it limits you to the type of fastener you can use in your wall. I would have liked to use Snap Toggle Bolts, But since toggle bolts strength relies on the bolt being tightened against the wall, so any form of toggle cannot be used. With this mounting method you have to leave the screw head away from the wall. You are pretty much stuck using the plastic anchors they provide if you have metal studs in your walls. I measured everything out and realized they did not mention what size hole to drill for the supplied anchors. I used a 3/8&#34; drill bit which seemed to work fine. Once the screws were in we hung the screen on. It went on fairly easily and then we realized we had to take it back down and tighten the screws some. We hung it back up and one screw was in to far, so we had to put the screen down and adjust the one screw. Once the screen was on it hung level, but does not sit astight against the wall as I would like. Attaching the bottom mounts we had to be careful and hold the top of the screen while lifting slightly so the screen would not pop off the upper mounts because it does that easily. I would also like some type of safety pin you could insert so the screen cannot come off the screw heads if some idiot lifts on the screen a little. I have put up a few screens over the years with friends and there are much better simple mounting methods. One is to aluminum bars that mount on the wall tightly ( you can use toggles ) and then the screen hangs on the bars and slides left or right easily. ( no adjusting screw heads in and out ) Then you have a bar on the bottom that once the screen is positioned you can insert a pin or machine screw threw the bottom of the frame into the bar to keep the screen locked on. I mention this safety because after finishing the install a friend came over to see the screen and the first thing he did was grab the side to see how sturdy it was. Trust me when I tell you it does not take much to lift this screen off the screw heads.<br />Pros:<br />Fairly Easy Assembly<br />Very Good Look and Quality<br />Great Picture Quality<br />Cons:<br />Wall Hanging System<br />Screen Support Rods Need Bettor Connectors<br />No mention of the appropriate drill size for the provided anchors<br /><br />Overall I love the way the screen looks on my wall and the performance I get with my projector.Attaching the bottom mounts we had to be careful and hold the top of the screen while lifting slightly so the screen would not pop off the upper mounts because it does that easily.

I tried another brand headset, but it had some strange controls that I couldn't get used to (especially a single button and switch for controlling phone and music).  So I tried these because they had two sets of controls that I was used to, and they looked like fun,  I bought 4 different color combinations.<br /><br />First thing to know-- I don't buy these to listen to music.  I use them for phone calls and to listen to audio books.  So I have no idea about sound quality.  I do like that these work well and pair easily to my iPhone.  Sound quality for this and for phone calls seems to be just fine.<br />The minuses-- when the battery charge starts going down, things fail quickly.  It won't pair easily and the microphone seems to go out during phone calls.  So I always have two of these headsets available.  As soon as the charge indicator for the headset on my iPhone goes down a level, I put this one back on charge and start using the second one.  When it goes down, I switch them out again.  Listening to audiobooks, the headset seems to give me about 8-12 hours listening time before I do this, and this works great.  I have a Command hook on my nightstand where I hang the headsets while charging, so keeping two there is easy.<br />The only time one has failed though is with the on/off switch.  I guess I'm a bit rough on them since I never remember whether on is forward or back and I don't bother looking to see the words on the switch.  So I wrecked one so the switch no longer worked.  That's not totally their fault though.  I wanted a lower cost headset so I don't expect high end quality.  The other part that does fail is the led light that indicates ,charged' or ,charging', but I don't use that anyway.  That has failed on 2 of the 4 units I have.<br /><br />2 headsets gets me through the day listening about 12-16 hours/day, and they recharge within a couple hours.day, and they recharge within a couple hours.",2015-08-30

I’ve tried a good number of the “better” ear buds – Bose, Klipsch, Shure – and I was eager to see how the Gibson Trainer TH100/27 compared.<br /><br />First – the Gibson sound is excellent, certainly a noticeable step up from the ear buds I’ve used. I’m very pleased with their clarity, tone and detail.<br /><br />Once set up, the Bluetooth feature is also wonderful – so nice to avoid tangled cords (where do those knots come from?!?!) or cords that sometimes get in your way working out.  It’s got great range too – I turn on my iPad, leave it on a table and listen to music all over the house.<br /><br />The headphones look great – stylish and subtle.  Pairing with a device is fairly straightforward. The controls are understated, though, and I had a bit of a learning curve before I became completely comfortable using them. There’s an indicated left/right alignment, which you should use to remember control placement. I found I took off the headphones at first to search for controls.<br /><br />One minor note – there’s an LED “nightnav” blinking light for safety. But I always walk facing traffic and, when used per the manufacturer’s recommendation, the light shines to your rear. Would have been nice to have the light visible both ways.<br /><br />There's also an “Activating Safe Sound” mode for safety, which basically turns down the intensity of the music. Frankly, I never use it. The sound difference is noticeable, but I still don’t trust headphones on the street at any reasonable volume to pick up all ambient noise. Gotta use your eyes and constantly look around!<br /><br />I’ve used the headphones for about 4 weeks and they are holding up well to perspiration (unlike some expensive ear buds I've purchased).<br /><br />I guess my only significant complaint with the Gibson Trainer is the fit. In short, they’re a bit tight for me. (I wear a“large” cap). The plus is that they do stay securely on your head, but the flip side is a loss in comfort. To compound the fit issue, the ear pieces have minimal padding. One other wear issue – the headphones bow out from the head just above the ears, making it hard to keep a baseball cap securely on while active.",2015-08-30

Although these days I prefer rechargeables, these batteries have their uses. Lithium primaries are a lithium iron disulfide chemistry and in the U.S. Energizer has the patent on it, so no one else can make them, at least here. Compared to other secondaries like NiMH and most other lithium ion batteries, they have great shelf life (up to 20 years)***, excellent temperature tolerance (-40 to -140 degrees F), and output voltage (1.5V vs. 1.2V for NiMH). They perform well in high drain applications that ordinary alkalines aren't really adequate for, such as photographic equipment, infrared night vision equipment, etc. The difference between the L91's and the L92's is the L91's are rated for 3.0A discharge current and are AA and the L92's are only 1.5A and are AAA.<br /><br />As far as using them in devices around the house goes, such as remotes and flashlights, which is what I'm concerned with, lithiums will outperform alkaline batteries, as well as most NiMH batteries. Battery Guy over on the CPF (CandlePowerForum.com) points out that flashlights that have 2W draw or less per cell will do better with Li-Ion primaries. Above 2W, he says you will get longer runtime using NiMH types.<br /><br />Overall a good product if you need it and don't want to mess with the additional device of a charger. Unfortunately they're no longer made in the U.S. as production was moved to Singapore in the last couple of years.<br /><br />By the way, safely charging lithium ion batteries requires some extra knowledge and skill. You should read the CPF battery forum and go to BatteryUniversity.com for more information if you plan to do it. That's what I did and I'm now almost 100% in rechargeables for both NiMH and Li-Ion. Rechargeableis can save you a lot of money over the long term. Finally, the PDF data sheet from Energizer is here: http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/l91.pdf<br /><br />***Note: There are some exceptions. Lithium thionyl chloride batteries also last very long, said to be as long as 25 years, but these are special use cells and not generally used by the average consumer. They are often used for memory backup, and are common in applications which require long life, where extreme temperature tolerance is needed, and where maintenance will be infrequent, such as remote arctic weather station equipment and sensors, remote animal tracking devices, remote alarm systems, etc.<br /><br />Note that they are not actually a lithium ion type and are not rechargeable. Tadiran, SAFT, and Varta are among the few companies that makes them and sell them in the U.S. The Varta sales and technical handbook has some good info and is here: http://www.varta-microbattery.com/applications/mb_data/documents/sales_literature_varta/handbook_primary_lithium_cylindrical_series_er_en.pdfbatteries also last very long, said to be as long as 25 years, but these are special use cells and not generally used by the average consumer.

Meaning if you toggle the remote to the next device, it will only go to the next physcially attached device - for example:  if you only have 2 devices attached - and you are on the 1st one, clicking the next will go to the 2nd device, hitting next again will then go back to the 1st device as technically it is the next device as nothing else is attached.

I never planned on buying a pair personally, but that doesn't mean l wasn't interested in trying them out. They always seemed like an unnecessary luxury item. Nice, but something l could probably live without. I always wondered about the Beats and constantly questioned their quality whenever l passed someone who wore them. This was my chance to finally check out what l had been missing, to test them and see what the hype was all about for myself.<br /><br />First off the packaging. You can tell that they really put a lot of care into making the unwrapping of the product an experience. Simple but sleek. The way it opens up reveals this little pouch which contains the headphones are in is sublime. Presentation is impressive l must say. I was asked to select a colour of my choice and so l chose the red ones as they made a visual impression. The wide range of colours are very attention-grabbing, there's one for all styles and taste. I put them on and was surprised at how comfortable they were. I wouldn't say they're amazing, but better than l expected them to be in terms of comfort. They don't feel too heavy nor too light which is a plus in my book. I like to feel that l'm wearing headphones without having them being too heavy or crushing my ears. These go on the ear, so if you like an over the ear headphone you might want to look at something else instead.<br /><br />The cord is another story. It's not very long and isn't adjustable but that was to be expected. It does comes with a mic and buttons for volume adjustment. The real gripe l have with the cord is it won't go into auxiliary inputs easily. You have to push it very hard to go in. Design is to blame on this. Even the end of the cord that goes into the headphones can cause problems such as loss of sound in one ear. You always have to check on both ends to make sure the headphones are not broken. The first time l tried them on they worked just fine. When l came home later that night they only had sound out of the left ear all of a sudden, l thought maybe they were broken. After multiple tries and fussing with the cord l got them to work but not without trial and error and switching the ends. It's difficult to explain and perhaps sounds exaggerated, but it's a rather common complaint.<br /><br />I've owned quite a few lair of headphones in my life, ranging from old-school to earbuds to gaming and studio headphones. One common complain when buying headphones is the bass sound, or lack thereof. The Beats have a great low-end bass sound and do not suffer from this problem. From the first listen it was clear to me that these headphones have a better than average bass sound. I tried them with different styles of music (Rock, Pop, Jazz etc) and the bass stood out to me as l was able to pick up on things that l hadn't previously heard. I also tried the Beats for gaming, watching television and playing bass guitar and they work really well for all mediums and everyday use. I don't think the highs are anything to write home about, but altogether they have a solid sound and the bass is great.<br /><br />They're very stylish and elegant, but they still retain that certain quality that makes them appealing to everyone ranging from kids to grown attention. Students have them. People on the bus wear them. They have the &#34;it&#34; factor. They come in all these bright colours that pop and grab your attention. I get a lot of nice comments on my red ones. They fold unlike any headphones l've seen before which is impressive, but may be part of a flawed design. The Beats are quite comfortable, yet very fragile. You hear these horror stories and see the pictures demonstrating just how frail they really are. I believe the way fold into themselves (litterally) may be to blame. If l'm going to pay a steep price for electronic goods, they better last and l don't know that Beats by Dre are reliable and can be depended upon.<br /><br />In the end it's more of a marketing triumph than innovation and quality. Yes, you'll get extremely sleek and stylish headphones. And yes, they are pretty comfortable. The bass and overall sound is decent. However, what you are left with are cool looking headphones that retail far beyond market value. And frail ones at that, they feel like they could break at any moment at the slightest touch. I'll give Beats By Dre this: they may be the best-looking pair of headphones ever made available to the general public. If anything, Beats can be taken as a valid lesson in marketing. Consumers buy them because of how they look and how they feel wearing them, largely as a result of clever advertising.<br /><br />If you're expecting more than cool looking headphones wrapped in beautiful packaging with an incredible sales pitch and presentation, you may be disappointed. If you want to look cool, fit in and spend 229$ on headphones that should probably retail for less than half of that then these are the ones for you. They're not bad 'phones by any means, maybe even slightly better than your average pair, but l found them to be ultimately overhyped and overpriced. I suggest you do some more browsing and look at what else you can get for your hard earned dollars. 3 stars.ts by Dre are reliable and can be depended upon.

I have two pairs of over-ear and one pair of on-ear headphones, and I swear by them because they provide the best sound currently on the market and the most comfort for long-term listening in my opinion. That said, the one issue you run into with larger headphones is with storage. This is especially bad if you have children, which I do, because they sometimes want to be like their parent and end up wrecking hundreds of dollars in items; I say that having had it happen once, which was my fault but horrifying nonetheless. Even if you do not kids, you still do not want to be haphazardly sitting your expensive electronics around and you can also benefit from properly displaying your headphones.<br /><br />The Hengja remedies any storage issue you have by allowing you to add a clip to just about any flush surface, be it a desk or a bookshelf and so on, and through easy adjust, and hang your headphones. You can adjust the clamp to hang how you want and I have also been adjusting the clamp to sit sit both vertical or horizontal, depending on needs. If you look at the picture you can see how it has a hex bolt in the center, which will allow you to adjust how it hangs.  Since this is a manual clamp, having it positioned in an up/down position is more likely to cause slipping so I mostly affix it horizontally. This is user preference, however, and I have not had any issues with it slipping/falling.<br /><br />The Hengja is solidly constructed and it is a relatively simple design, so you do not have to worry about long-term considerations. I like the fact that it is made the way it is, with a curved contour for the headphones to rest, and I like that it is crafted from metal and has no moving items that will wear down and give out.<br /><br />To note, there is no Allen wrench for the hex bolt included, but you can pick one up really cheaply or probably have one already in your home if you have ever had to assemble an item you purchased.<br /><br />Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and that sampling does not impact review rating. The Hengja is a good product and I am picking up a couple more for storage and aesthetic reasons, plus I like the Brainwavz responsiveness in general.cheaply or probably have one already in your home if you have ever had to assemble an item you purchased.<br /><br />Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and that sampling does not impact review rating.

US,53087372,R34132N71EDN55,B012J1B8CG,102731051,Philips AJT Bluetooth Dual Alarm Clock Radio iPhone/Android Speaker Dock Speakerphone Microphone …,Electronics,2,0,0,Y,N,"Small footprint, big problems","This is much smaller than older clock radios. The readout is not as big, either, so take this into consideration. The footprint is compact, and this is a boxy shape. It can run on backup batteries (not included) and the all-digital set up makes tuning the radio as well as setting the clock (12 or 24 hour time) sensible, in theory. An orange (not green) display can be set three ways for dimness or brightness, a good touch.<br /><br />The top has settings for phone input, Bluetooth, and a double alarm for two stations and/or two times to awaken. A dial tunes the station. I wondered why this was not included as a button on top, however. There is also a large snooze button, the largest and closest to the front. This also sets the lighting of the readout three ways, and I wonder in spite of instructions how one large panel does these two functions.<br /><br />At first, I thought this was good to go out of the box. But try as I might,  for days I could not get the radio to play--static only. I spent a long time with the manual. I went online to find no listing under Philips' own support for AJT4400B{the /37] is not listed on the instructions. (&#34;Sunday&#34; in a comment kindly shared the URL to the online manual after I posted my original version of this review.) I had eventually found that same manual online by a search off the manufacturer's site--where the product from the home page did not appear at all! This is odd.<br /><br />There are a lot of buttons to hold and let go and the set-up seems too complicated for what I had assumed a simple device, at least as a basic clock-radio. I did get the radio to work by sheer chance, I am not sure how. There is a problem in that the snooze button and the brightness triple setting use the same large button. While placed logically for both needs, this means you can activate sleep without wanting it and this shuts off the radio or alarm---too much economy to keep a smooth set of buttons on top leads to frustrations in practical use.<br /><br />So, how is the radio? I live in a big city but the nearby FM stations came in not that well. I extended the antenna all the way. The sound quality is like a transistor radio from past decades. It does come frontally and not from the back or side, but even with this, the volume is a surprise: very soft. At all the way up, level 15, it is just audible at my arm's reach. I'd expect full volume to be heard at least all over a room.<br /><br />Finally, after a few minutes, the radio fades. It is too weak to &#34;hold&#34; an FM signal. Despite my moving the short wire antenna all around, it cannot capture a station from inside my house despite it being on the top floor near a window. The station starts to come in when first tuned, but then it gives out. Old radios used to have an &#34;AFC&#34; lock toggle switch to secure FM signals. That might have helped here.I live in a big city but the nearby FM stations came in not that well. I extended the antenna all the way. The sound quality is like a transistor radio from past decades.

As an audio-nut I own lots of headphones including several sets of wired, conventional wireless, and Bluetooth headphones and I’ll say right up front that I’m surprised just how much I like these headphones. As a pretty hardcore audio-nut I’ve been disappointed by every set of Bluetooth headphones up to this point, including some with some pretty good ratings, and as a typical audio-nut I’m usually skeptical of anything labeled Bose.  However, these Bose SoundLink II headphones came as a very pleasant surprise. I spent several hours listening to a mix of music that included vocals, bass leads, intricate guitar, and a new age album that reliably trips up poor speakers and headphones alike – a test that every other Bluetooth headphone in my collection had failed miserably. But let’s start with the design.<br /><br />The SoundLink II headphones are conventional looking closed back headphones with all of the controls and a flush fitting microphone for use with a phone on the right side. For those new to headphones, closed headphones provide excellent isolation and privacy at the expense of sound quality. Generally speaking open headphones sound better, but at the cost of you hearing everything around you and everyone in the room hearing very clearly what you are listening to. The Soundlink II also functions as a Bluetooth headset for phone calls, and reports from friends are that the microphone sounds outstanding (better than any of my Plantronics headsets) in phone calls, however I did not test the microphone’s noise cancelling ability. Comfort was quite good even for my large head.<br /><br />I began my listening test with Diana Krall’s The Girl In The Other Room and was pleased to note that these Bose headphones captured the sultry smokiness of her vocals perfectly. Next I moved on to Chris Rea’s Hofner Blue Notes. In this rare jazz album an electric bass takes the role of the lead instrument and is accompanied by beautiful piano and drum work. Frankly I was afraid that the bass might be more than a set of Bluetooth headphones could reproduce cleanly, but I need not have worried because the Bose did a marvelous job of digging deep and reproducing those deep soulful bass riffs for a closed back headphone - when played at reasonable volumes. Crank up the volume too high and the bass starts getting muddy but that’s understandable. As a reality check I listened to of bass master Marcus Miller’s Nikki’s Groove and found the same to be the case, keep the volume reasonable on the bass heavy tunes. At normal safe listening levels they do a credible job for a closed headphone. Finally I spent some quality time with Manheim Steamroller’s Fresh Aire III. Whether or not this album is your cup of tea its deep powerful bass and airy mids and detailed highs do a great job of tripping up poor speakers. The SoundLink II passed the Fresh Air III test with flying colors.<br /><br />In conclusion, don’t expect these (or any other closed-back headphones) to compete with top of the line wired open-back headphones, but the SoundLinks are head and shoulders the best (and most expensive) Bluetooth headphones that I’ve listened to and I wouldn’t hesitate to buy a set if I were in the market.",2015-08-30

Streaming services are simple to set up, and if they haven't been activated a Cambridge Audio tech's voice comes on and tells you where to go to activate that service...what impressed me is, although it's a script, it's just a guy reading it, no digital computer sound, it's a high quality recording of him talking. The physical DAC is simply beautiful. Stunning finish and well thought out buttons/labels. The labels on the back are all written both right side up and upside down for ease of use, let me tell you, it helps a lot! Button clicks and turning the dial (also is a select button) are very reassuring and solid, the dial has good weight to it and is very smooth to turn.<br /><br />Appearances aside, sound, the sound is what we all came here for. Is it good? Nope, great? Not really.... Those words don't describe the difference I'm getting here. The sound out of this DAC is absolutely astonishing. It's totally ruined the sound of a pair of cheap headphones I use as a headset for Skype with friends. I used to tolerate them and now they're just not hearable...I know what I need to buy next, a replacement to my laziness with those. As for the sound, Cambridge Audio is known for having a bit (I mean a BIT) of a warm bias to their sound, which honestly is a good thing to me. It pulls some of the harsh sounds out of my tweeters, that can sometimes blast the feathers off an innocent bird. The overall tone is very well balanced and matches music with precision I've never heard before. DSD files (which you can NOW play with the NEWEST firmware update) sound incredible, DSD is a bit (again I mean BIT, haha) warm as a file type, so that pairs very well with a DAC like this. There is absolutely no skipping or seeking in the files and the DAC has no trouble blasting them apart with it's dual Wolfson chips. If you get nothing out of all this, moral here is that it sounds wonderful and it's simple to get to that sound.<br /><br />As a network player (that's why we bought it right?) it does well, Spotify was simple to link to it, and then due to how the DAC works, you will notice a difference. (All audio, outside of DSD, is up-sampled to PCM 24-bit/384kHz before hitting the DACs.) other services such as pandora and rhapsody work well and smoothly play your music as long as you have a good internet connection.<br /><br />What do I think as an overall?<br /><br />Assuming you read the review, you'll know that I would give this DAC very high praise, it delivers, then gives you a gold platter, then keeps handing you things.<br /><br />If you didn't read it, because a wall of text is long right? I very much recommend this product. I'm half tempted to call Cambridge Audio and tell them how happy with it I am and how much I like the little touches they put into it. The sound is marvelous and there is absolutely no way you'll out file this DAC, it handles anything you give it. (within it's supported formats obviously. DSD64 is the limit there, but even then, DDSD and up aren't totally necessary and cost much more to achieve.)",2015-08-30
US,38377528,RMYEIZ48FCZU8,B00FX8RH4G,428389542,"Emotiva Audio XDA-2 USB DAC, Digital Preamp & Headphone AMP",Electronics,1,5,14,N,Y,Don't buy if you are using Windows 10,"I was foolishly surprised at the size of this thing. I just assumed that it would be a reasonable size, certainly no bigger than my Teac 501 or Mytek Stereo DSD, both of which also have balanced outputs and also play DSD. I was floored when the box arrived. At 19&#34; wide and 22&#34; deep, it won't fit on any of my media shelves or equipment racks. Still, had it performed well, I probably would have kept it. I wasn't expecting sound on the same level as my Teac or Mytek, but I did think that it should be on a par with my $200 ifi-Nano which also plays DSD and is only the size of a pack of cigarettes. Boy was I wrong. Regardless of resolution, the XDA-2 obscures detail rendering music lifeless. Instruments are blurred together, and voices are hard to distinguish. In addition, it certainly doesn't meet its SNR specs in either the preamp or head phone amp mode. I couldn't believe that I heard noise through my Sennheiser 600s, even at very modest volume levels. That's a first for me with any DAC I've tried. Then I cranked up the volume driving my new Parasound A23 amp in balanced mode with quality interconnects and guess what? More noise. Believe me, when I run the Teac, Mytek, or ifi DACs through the Parasound at full volume there's total silence. The final clincher was the issue with the Windows 10 driver. My anti-virus software wouldn't let me download it, so I had to disable my virus protection in order to get the driver form Emotiva. This driver would not recognize the XDA-2 on all of my Windows 10 computers, although I was able to find a C Media driver that would. Still, there is a serious issue with either the C Media- or Emotiva-supplied driver in Windows 10 - when the XDA-2 is turned off and on or disconnected while the computer is running, you have to reboot the computer in order to use the XDA-2 at any resolution other that 16-bit 44 or 48k!!!  For me, this is a major inconvenience. After two frustrating days of trying to get the software issue resolved,  Ipacked it up and got a return authorization from Amazon. Thank you again Amazon for your amazing customer support.",2015-08-30

After reviewing some forums and reviews on this product it seems that failure in some rows seems to happen more often than not and once one starts in a row the rest will follow said pattern.<br /><br />The connections in my opinion would be more ideal if they were facing up because the way these outlets are facing they seem to get in the way of other connectors depending on the thickness of them so if i have to use multiple i have to skip one outlet to leave enough space for connections to hook up properly. Doing this at this point renders some of the 8 ports useless because of the other cords space.<br /><br />If the outlets were facing the other way the phones chargers and other cables would face to the sides of this unit not causing it to block the neighboring ports. It seems they spaced out the ports with an intent to accomadate other connections however the outlets should be facing up and sideways for this to be effective.<br /><br />I like the one that i actually got working but i wouldn't advise getting one of these if you actually want to use all 8 outlets instead get one that has the ''faces'' facing up not sideways like these because connections do get in the way of nearby ports.,2015-08-30

In short their infrastructure is inadequate for our service area and the signal has trouble making it back (upstream) to Comcast.  We've had dozens of days in which the internet quits working up to 75 times a day for up to 5 minutes (T4 timeout and reset).  This is our only option and obviously a nightmare.  Our upstream Power Level before hooking this up was usually between 38-41 so I was skeptical this would even help.  I hooked it up and it has made a tremendous difference immediately and our internet is perhaps 85%+ better overall.  On the best days we will barely have a single interruption lasting only a couple seconds.  On the absolute worst days it cuts the interruptions down at least in half if not more and often I can avoid the T4 timeout by quickly adjusting the return signal up a little.  This may not sound that great but you have to understand our internet is incredibly terrible.  To adjust the signals you need a small straight slot screwdriver.  I made some little wire things that fit inside the adjustment screws so that I can adjust it on the fly.  In most situations you probably shouldn't do this and instead should find optimal settings and just leave it alone.  However our problem is a little unique as Comcast doesn't have enough bandwidth on their long run from town to town and with growth everyone is using more bandwidth which means every little problem causes packet loss.  For whatever reason in this case if you turn up the return signal a few DB the signal will make it back home.  I do this by running Ping Plotter on a second monitor which sends a ping every second to Comcast's CMTS to monitor for interruptions.  When it goes red I reach over and give the rvg a clockwise turn and it fixes it &#62;90% of the time.  After the anomaly stops I slowly turn the signal back down and the cable modem boosts its own signal back up.  You have to do this in small steps every 30 seconds (signal correction takes place every ~30 secs or so per DOCSIS specification) or else the signal can become too weak and you'll lose sync.  If that happens just turn it back up for a second until your cable modem adjusts.  To see these settings look at your CM configuration page (usually 192.168.100.1 or something similar in your browser (check your manufacturer)).  That will help you tune the signals both directions for optimal use.  With the Upstream Power Level it will change every 30 seconds as you adjust the screws, the modem adjust its output to what it thinks it supposed to be best.  So if it was 45dB before you hook this up and is 35dB after you hook it up, then it is likely boosting the signal by about 15dB (~5 is lost simply from hooking up the device) for a net of about 10dB boost.  In the end you end up with a signal that is the same as before you hooked up this amplifier so it shouldn't help in situations where the modem upstream power level is below 45dB but for whatever reason it works great for us even without adjusting the signal in real time.  Generally you want downstream Power Level at 0 dBmV but can adjust it up or down to try to get a better Signal to Noise Ratio.  I haven't found any correlation between a higher SNR and less problems when I crank it up to 5-10dB+.  If your problem is with a weak downstream signal it might help, especially if you mount this closer to the drop to your house to boost at the earliest point.  But for us this doesn't seem to have any effect as the problem only seems to be upstream.  I'm not a cable network engineer and what I'm saying here is a combination of what I've read on the net, guessing, and voodoo so I have no idea what exactly is true or correct.  All I know is that this device helps tremendously, the steps I outlined help, and it has made our internet much more usable.  Comcast has been promising to fix the problem with a huge upgrade project for the last 6 months and keeps telling me it'll be done in 30 days.Yeah right.  Until then this helps.",2015-08-30

The sound is fantastic; could not be happier with the performance. Been listening to radio and watching TV with it so far. Yesterday, my Blu Ray player arrived and we scheduled our first &#34;Movie Night&#34; as a family. Unfortunately, the screen and sound cut out/ went black and the screen read &#34;not supported&#34; or &#34;HDMI1 not found&#34;. It then corrected itself until it happened a couple more times. I tried a different HDMI cable, same issue occurred. Tried a different HDMI input and had same issue. I then connected it to the HDMI input that my cable TV was connected to and everything worked fine; no issues. I then connected my cable box to the BD input and then HDMI3 input and experienced the same black screen issue on both of those. So i've confirmed there is an issue with at least 2 of the HDMI inputs on this unit. As of this writing, i am awaiting a replacement device. I will post an update upon receiving the replacement unit. UPDATE 9/3/15: While awaiting my RMA, which i received within 2 days, i read some reviews about performing a firmware update. I updated my firmware from 1.4 to 1.5.  Since performing the update (which took ~30 minutes to complete via USB), the issue has not resurfaced. I am cautiously optimistic. Increasing this review to 3 stars and will update again in a few more days after i have some time to perform additional testing... UPDATE 9/5/2015: Could not make it through the first night of testing, post-firmware update. Watching Optimum worked fine. No video cutting out issue. Had the neighbors' kids over to watch a movie. Nothing i did would get a picture from the DVD player. Ran a firmware update on that as well, no dice. Bypassed the receiver and went straight to the projector- worked fine (without sound, of course). Connected the same DVD player to 2 other TVs - no problem. At this point, i've lost all patience with this device. lowering to 1 star- when it works, it sounds fantastic. Shame it doesnt work properly. i originally asked for a replacement, but now i will simply return this device and look for a different brand. UPDATE 9/9/2015: Picked up a different receiver (Pioneer Elite VSX90) this weekend. Everything works great, no issues. I will say- the Yamaha sounded better IMO, though i havent pushed the Pioneer yet. Happy with my new purchase.",2015-08-30

There are few that are made by anyone whose name you'd recognize though. APC is one of the preeminent makers of battery back-ups, surge suppressors and electrical conditioning devices so you're getting a lot of quality behind the name and a company you can find for service or help without having to learn Mandarin.<br /><br />This unit will recharge most smart phones one time, a Kindle e-reader at least once and put enough charge on a Fire or other tablet to get some more use.  (3,000 milli-amp hours).<br /><br />It's about the size and rough shape of a large Bic lighter, about 3&#34; high by 1.25&#34; across and .74&#34; deep and weights about 2 ounces.  The casing is solid aluminum and reasonably thick.  Top, bottom and sides.  There's the sort of density to this that tells you they didn't skimp on things.  It'll fit in almost any pocket or purse and even a kid can carry some spare power this way.  There's no flex of give anywhere, it's just solid.  And that's a good thing for this stuff.<br /><br />Operation is as simple as can be:  Plug the supplied cord into the device and a USB port on a computer or what have you and let it charge.  There's an LED light to let you know the status.  (It arrived almost fully charged as is.)<br /><br />Once charged up, that's it until you need it.  You'll need to supply the usb connector from the &#34;juice box&#34; to your device but almost everyone has those by the handful these days.<br /><br />To use it, plug it into your device and push the small LED/power switch to turn it on and let it charge.  A longer push will turn it back off when you are done and the switch is mostly recessed so it won't be turned on by accident is not so hard to work that you will invent new swear words trying to use it.  A nice design feature often lacking on cheap ones<br /><br />That's it.  Simple and effective as the best tech usually is.  I got this for my wife who is new to smartphones and hasn't got used to how fast her phone runs down sometimes.<br /><br />I am a techie by trade and I have a small arsenal of these and this is the most compact one of the lot and I love it.  Ideal for day trips that may run long or just to have in case you need it since phones 8always* run out at a critical moment.<br /><br />One caveat:  it will not charge a tablet fully nor will it charge the bigger ones quickly but it's not meant for that although it will work in a pinch.  There's models out there for that but they cost  both in dollars and in bulk and mass.  I have one that will charge anything short of a real laptop and it's the size of a paperback book and weighs almost a pound but I can run a smart phone off it for a week nearly or an okld flip phone I still use from now until the sun dies.<br /><br />Anyone with a cell phone should have one of these.  Tuck it in your purse or briefcase, backpack or pocket, glove box or console anytime you go out with a phone as that ability to give it a charge might just mean the difference in a crisis or accident.  And is just plain handy any time you worry about getting through the day without losing communications.<br /><br />This is far and away the best built one I have seen.

I have used it in one flight and seems to do the job. I did not time it but Im not sure it can last 27 minute flight time with a H3-3D and GoPro connected to it. If I can add to this review, I will and I won't hold things back. What I have noticed that it fits snug within the drone and sometimes I feel it fits better then the original battery. It does work on the Phantom 2.

Arrived within 3 days as they said it would.<br />Update........<br />I have an update on my purchase of the battery. I have flown with it twice and I'm a little concerned about the performance of it. They claim or say you can get about 27 minutes of flight time out of it but that's not true in my case. First flight lasted 15 minutes then by the third flight 10 minutes. 10 minutes with a gopro 3+ on it and the gopro was fully charged.<br />To be fair, I have not contacted the seller yet because I just got back from flying the DJI Phantom 2. Could be a bad battery or something but I haven't had a chance to speak to them.<br />If my flights continue or get worse then I would say the batteries are not worth buying. More testing will happen soon. I will add more comments for updates.<br /><br />Oct 1, 2015 I'm writing a follow up and changed my review from a 2 to a 4 star. I was a little disappointed  with the battery at first because of how short the flights were. After contacting them, they sent out a new one at no charge.

My cat is frightened of it, that's how much it moves.<br />So you're forced to listen to stuff at lower, more hard to hear volumes... exactly what I didn't want.<br />Also, it is big, and heavy.  You might as well sacrifice the smallest amount of sound quality and volume, and get something you can take places with you.  It might as well not be blue tooth, because the battery life is about 2 hours, and, partly I am to blame here, but the only thing that would easily sync to the bluetooth was my phone, no, ONE of my phones, the other was too hard, and I couldn't figure out how to bluetooth to my lap top and so have to sit with it plugged in via an AV cord.<br />I'll admit to being half the problem on that one.<br />Also, I don't like the buttons that aren't actually buttons because you can't feel them, you have to sit up and look at them, which is hard in the dark when you're watching netflix.

I'll get to the point:  sound quality for music is lacking. However, if you are a casual listener and are into jogging, strenuous activities and wet environments these may be perfect.<br /><br />Basically these phones have a distinct bias towards the higher frequencies, with a crossover to bass in my right ear and flat mid range response. In other words, if you are a critical listener you may want to consider other phones on the market. I was able to get decent bass response in my right ear using my phone's EQ app, but could not get any decent mid range. The net result is music sounds one dimensional (even with the bass response in one ear.) I am guessing that the crossover threshold is such that you get high frequencies in one ear and low in the other, with the mid somehow cut out or deemphasized. For folks who listen to audio books and inspirational or educational material this will not be an issue. I will say that even with the volume cranked the high end did not break up or become tinny.<br /><br />Despite the sound, I cannot find fault in the construction or ability to withstand harsh environments.  From a comfort perspective I had no problem wearing these for three hours with the medium buds that ship with it along with small and large ones. And I love the way they were securely held in place with the ear hooks. Another feature that I like is the cable is flat and tangle-free. Of course, the nicest feature is they are, indeed, waterproof.",2015-08-30

I am not going to claim this is the greatest speaker on the market, but will say that it's on my short list of favorites. In fact, while technology has continued to improve in the nine months since receiving this, it is still a contender.<br /><br />Here is that I especially like: first the sound quality is nicely  balanced among the high, mid and low frequency bands. At maximum volume the highs remain clear and full without breaking up of sounding tinny. The mids are truly rich, and the lows, while not booming bass, are also full.<br /><br />Sound projection is slightly better than many speakers this size. Most will work within two meters on a desk or night stand, whereas this one can be clearly heard across a room about five meters away. I appreciate that because I can leave this setting on my media shelf, playing, while I prepare a meal across the room in my kitchen.<br /><br />There are a few things that I find personally irritating. At the top of the list is the Poweradd NFC logo that lights up and blinks all the time. The controls behind it light up too, but go dark if not touched for a few seconds. I wish the logo would do the same because to me it's distracting. The other is the sensitivity of the controls. When they go dark you can re-illuminate them by swiping your finger across the top. That is a wonderful feature, but sometimes when you swipe your finger you also activate one of the buttons. That 'feature' irritates me. But I can live with those issues.<br /><br />I do like the NFC (near field communication) feature where all you have to do is set an NFC-enabled phone or tablet on the logo and it will automatically initiate a pairing and connecting process. Most modern phones and tablets are now NFC-enabled, so even if you are a technophobe you will love that feature. My Note 3 in a heavy leather case had no problems with pairing via NFC.<br /><br />At about a third of the volume level I was able to get the total twelve hours of play time from this speaker. At max volume about half that. It does take about twelve hours to charge one of these from total rundown to full using a 1 Amp wall charger.<br /><br />Overall, I obviously love this speaker because I donate most of my review samples and kept this one. This one has respectable sound and sound quality, and is easy to use. If you are looking for a first bluetooth speaker bookmark this one as you compare because it truly is reliable and solid.d of the volume level I was able to get the total twelve hours of play time from this speaker.

Simply put, the synergy is incredible. The extra warmth of the tube amp balances the slightly aggressive Grado sound signature... a little sweet to Grado's spicy.<br /><br />You can swap tubes, as well as opamps, to fine tune the sound but I was very impressed with just the stock hardware. The SR80e/I+ combo was particularly suited to rock and jazz records. The fuzziness of an electric guitar, the sweetness of a trumpet, this amp gives character and depth to every instrument.<br /><br />Just be sure to match your components well when you purchase an amp. This amp, with its swappable tubes and opamps, can pair with just about any brand of headphone. But moving up the Grado scale with my Grado RS1e, which are 3x the cost of the Little Dot, the amp was clearly out of its depth. My Elekit TU8200 is better suited for the high end headphone duties. But for a secondary/desk system or a mid-fi headphone rig,  I have not heard a better amp than the I+, especially given my preference for Grados.

This is my 10th month with these earphones and I've had no issues at all. On three occasions, the earphone has been pulled apart completely so it was just hanging by the exposed wire (yep, life with kids is an adventure :-). I pushed the ear phone in again and it worked! Now I have owned enough earphones (20+) in my life time to know that has never happened in the history of earphones. I was blown away. 5 stars!<br /><br />Mircophone: Mic is good, people on the other side hear you loud and clear. I'm big on hands free and use it in telephone conferences for work all the time. I've never had an issue.<br /><br />Ergonomics: comes with ear buds in 3 sizes, and they are very comfortable, I have them on overnight sometimes (I'm looking at you youtube) with no issues. I just love that the plug that goes into the phone is bent at right angles instead of just sticking out the phone. I find this really adds to the durability.<br /><br />Playback: Hit the button on the mic, and music stops playing. Hit it again, it starts playing. Hit it twice in quick succession and it even skips to the next song!<br /><br />Sound quality: Ok lets be realistic. These are $9 earphones. I'm sure there are $200 earphones out there, that may sound better. But for the price, the sound quality here is AMAZING! I've a collection of over 500 songs on my phone, ranging from heavy metal to jazz to contemporary pop and they do not disappoint.

US,44373409,R1SKFKMXXP0RSU,B00WU2KJSO,955611184,Philips A1Pro/27 Professional DJ Headphones  designed with Armin Van Buuren- Black,Electronics,5,0,1,Y,N,Excellent quality,"These are phenomenal headphones, hands down the best I've ever used. They're such high quality and have so many great features that even a non-audiophile will notice the difference immediately.<br /><br />I'd never had the opportunity to use any professional-quality headphones or speakers so I'd always figured the difference was so minimal that only die-hard perfectionists would notice any improvement in the sound. Wow, was I wrong. They do a terrific job of cancelling background noise. I'm noticing background instruments and effects I've never heard before in songs I've listened to for years. Which is not always good, believe it or not; some are downright distracting. This is true across all genres of music, though I find techno/electronica to be the biggest beneficiary of these headphones (no surprises there). Obviously, the quality of the base recording is the biggest factor here. For instance, I couldn't have told you before that Apple provides higher quality mp3s than Amazon does. Is it worth converting a whole library for this? Maybe any old favorites you've still got hanging around at 128 kps. You might even find some new favorites -- I certainly did.<br /><br />Comfort is another big priority for me. As someone who regularly gets head/neck fatigue from headphones along with headaches and migraines from wearing them, these in every way minimize my problems. Which is a pleasant surprise given their weight. They took some getting used to, I won't deny that. I spent a whole month wearing them to give my honest opinion in this regard. It didn't quite take that long to break them in, but I can now wear them for hours without much of a problem. I don't get headaches from wearing them, which can't be said for any other headphones I've ever owned.<br /><br />I was a bit suspect of their quality given their DJ endorsement, but there's no shoddy workmanship on these. They definitely have a lot of weight to them, but they feel solid and well-made. It's a tight fit but the ear shells do a great job of distributing the pressure. The headband is wrapped in leather for great cushioning and it's light. My average-sized ears just fit inside the ear cushions the unit comes packaged with. From time to time I'll feel some pinching nothing a quick readjustment doesn't fix. Anyone with larger/smaller ears will probably want to swap the sizes. My unit did NOT come with the other sizes (the description says they are included)<br /><br />If that wasn't reason enough to like these, the list of cool features doesn't end there. The ear shells can collapse and swivel for ease of transport without worrying they'll break. Wearing them one-eared is more handy that I thought, given the surprising amount of noise reduction these headphones provide. I'm not crazy about the coiled cable, but I've warmed up to its benefits. One thing that really helps it is that it can be plugged into either ear shell and rotated to lock in. I love that! They look fantastic too. Classy design.<br /><br />I have yet to find something I dislike about these headphones. Some people might argue the price is too high, but if you could be assured of their extreme high quality, comfort, and added features, is that not worth the cost? I'd say it is. Highly recommended!he ear shells do a great job of distributing the pressure. The headband is wrapped in leather for great cushioning and it's light.

The size and style works well with a spare tire bracket mount on my JK, it sticks up just enough above the soft top.  Haven't hit any tree limbs with it yet but seems like it will hold up well.  No spring mount needed because the spare tire will limit its motion anyway.  Used an 18' fire ring cable to run it to my arm rest console.

Not having to manually reset the belt for 45rpm.<br />After four years with my RM 1.3, this was a sound investment.<br />Be sure your motor/model is compatible first.",2015-08-30

I have used it in a few other instances but primarily, I have it attached to my bike for longer rides. From what I can tell, the rear  of the speaker has some sort of passive radiator to tune the bass output.  With EQ, you can reduce the midrange and treble to bring out more of the mid-bass frequencies, giving it a fuller sound outdoors.  In an enclosed space, though, this little thing can play quite loud!<br /><br />My one regret is that the bracket has no facilities to mount the speaker anywhere.  I do not want to drill into the plastic but I really would prefer to mount this using one or two brackets that could attach this to the handlebar securely. I have considered modifying a bottle cage to carry it (it is too small to fit a standard cage without rattling around), or finding some other way to attach it.  I've put hundreds of miles on the speaker so far and it has held up wonderfully--it lives up to its &#34;rugged&#34; description.",2015-08-30

There is also a rubberised layer beneath the speaker, to help avoid scratches and marks on furniture.<br />A USB to mini-USB charge lead is included which you plug into the mini-USB input socket located on the right hand side of the speaker, which enables you to charge up the speaker from a USB compatible socket plug, or the USB input socket of a desktop PC or laptop.<br />A small orange LED illuminates on the top of the speaker when it's charging. The light turns itself off once the speaker is fully charged - I'd figure on a charge time of roughly 3 to 4 hours from a completely flat battery. Fully charged the playtime is around 10 hours.<br />Pairing the speaker with a Bluetooth enabled device is very easy. Your device pairs with the speaker once the blue LED stops flashing and you have selected the speaker in the settings. I've never had any issues pairing my iPhone 6.<br />You can also use this speaker with non-Bluetooth devices, using the supplied AUX in.<br />There are four rubberised control buttons on the top of the speaker - a power on-off button, play button, and a volume up and down.<br />The sound performance and quality of this speaker really out does its relatively modest proportions.<br />The bass response is good with the speaker featuring MaxxBass technology and two passive subwoofers for enhanced bass performance.<br />The mid-range is warm and very well defined. Piano, lead guitar, snare drum, synth chords and vocals are nicely reproduced and avoid sounding artificial or manufactured.<br />The treble response is sharply defined, and very nicely crisp and clear, it's not a raspy, screechy or jarring high range. Vocal andclarinet high notes, and synth lead-line melodies, etc., are rich and distinct.<br />Even turned right up to full volume, this speaker doesn't distort its sound reproduction and sounds very loud with two 10 drivers giving 20 watts of output overall.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely impressed with this bluetooth speaker and will be using it outside in the garden as much as possible.",2015-08-30

It uses a wire antenna that plugs into the earphone port. A poor execution. It should use a dipole antenna for this. Instead you have to be sure to plug in the antenna and that you don't lose it. Disappointing.  Also, there is an open slot on the battery cover. Dust, etc could get in there. Not a good design in my opinion. They could have put clear plastic on the slot and you could still see whether the battery is there, but no dust or moisture would enter the open slot.

The sound quality is amazing, and is comparable to that of the more expensive brands, but if the music doesn't play smoothly and keeps annoyingly triggering Siri every 5 seconds the entire experience isn't as enjoyable anymore.<br />However, if you experience any problems with the earbuds, the amazing customer service would gladly replace it for you relatively quickly.<br /><br />Update: I was pleasantly surprised after symphonized reached out to me concerning the review I put in before about Siri and the weird flaw with the earphones. They told me that I had a received an old version of their headphones (one that wasn't compatible with the iPhone 6 because Apple changed the headphone jack for the iPhone 6). They replaced my earphones and they work perfectly now, no problems with Siri or anything. These earphones are now absolutely perfect, and the amazing customer service that Symphonized has, makes these earphones way better.",2015-08-30

Nice.<br />The audio quality is as can be expected. I listen to music occasionally and it sounds good enough through these earbuds. For conversations on the phone (what I use it for most), the audio is perfectly good enough.<br />The only gripe I have is that the wires still get tangled in spite of the their tangle-free feature.

Perfect for on the go!,"[[VIDEOID:8511cd9117b4430eace7567b5d588f51]] This Bluetooth speaker is much smaller than I had expected but wow does it pack a punch with sound. It gets so much louder than I expected for something this small. I love that because it makes it super portable and fits right in your purse. It's only 2in high and 2in across. The aluminium shell keeps the speaker well protected from damage during transports or if it is dropped or falls to the ground.<br /><br />The bass is ok but it is a tiny little speaker so there really isn't much area for the air needed for a real deep sound. It gives 3 watts of output. it can produce but given the size it sounds pretty good. Knowing the size before I ordered that was already expected. The volume is impressive to say the least. You can easily hear it over other chit chat and outside noise.<br /><br /> I did have some hassles trying to pair it with my older LG but my LG G4 picked it up quickly. There is also a slot for a memory card so you can play your files directly from that if it isn't convenient to use your phone or computer. Not many bluetooth speakers offer that feature, especially in this price range. I personally think it's maybe just a tad overpriced for what you get sound quality wise but for portability and volume it's pretty amazing.<br /><br />You are able to receive calls through this speaker which is another feature that not all BT speakers offer. I'm very pleased with it's performance and gel that overall it's a good little speaker.<br /><br />I did receive my Red Star Bluetooth Speaker free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but- that doesn't mean I HAVE to like it. If it's garbage I have no problem calling it out.  My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions with this product.

US,42149667,R2Q12KVW1EZFUO,B003CJTR8M,650053239,Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphones,Electronics,2,5,5,N,Y,i normally go for neckband because i find it more comfortable than any other,"i bought the first headphone in jan 2014 and the left earpiece stopped working in december.<br />second order was place in mid jan 2015 and the right stopped working at the end of august.<br />i normally go for neckband because i find it more comfortable than any other. I would rather have a sound source around my ear where i can pick less that 95% of produced sound. And that's why i dont like in ear, over ear,etc. What i look for on my headphones are braided cables, in line microphone and volume control.<br />This philips only had braided cord and a restraining piece on the cable at the left earpiece to dampen tugs.<br />while my headphones worked, i was super happy about their performance. One great thing about this shs5200 over the ones that i previously owned is that, over time they would lose to produce sound quality. And very important, one earpiece would produce more or less sound than the other. This causes an unequal change in hearing sensitivity and the only way to find out is to take a full hearing test. I think i can &#34;hear quite well&#34; and the last time i took the audibility test, my hearing ability showed no signs of listening to music and everything. In regards to unequal sound, both of the headphones died/stopped working before it happened. Immediately before, they were working well and then one of the earpiece wouldnt produce sound. I would definitely give credit for that.<br />A lot of people prefer a non-leaking headpiece, which this isnt. If the volume is turned 75% or more, people around will be able to hear noise from you. For me, that's good because whatever the headphone is producing, i am hearing a portion and not forcibly sending everything down my ear channel. The people in the sound industry and the people who designs sound equipment do not come up with sound that is always ear-drum friendly. It's best for to leave ear and the passage and the drum and the brain to work out and interpret the sound.<br />The speakers on the pieces arent from heaven nor god made but i would say does a good job. If you want quality sound, or me looking for upscale experience i would first go for higher bit rate like 192kbps and more(256kbps) rather than buying expensive headphones and play regular 128kbps. It makes a difference. Try it for yourself.<br />For me both headphones were comfortable. A tip if you are buying it; hold onto the box it comes with. If you put it in your backpack or you end up sleeping on the top, the headphone will go out of shape. What you need to do then, is just put it in the box it came with, the plastic piece that the headphone is properly seated during shipping; the flexible band will go to its original position. Physically and externally, this is a good design.<br />However, the soldering inside the earpiece and the way cables are connected, is more or less the same as cheap headphones. I was able to disassemble both headphone and including it in the review. There was a good attempt for a better construction which is the heat shrink and the only thing that i didnt find in other less expensive headphones(i havent opened expensive ones).<br />philips  headphones are also a lot less outside US which i just found out and a huge bummer. The first piece i bought was from gibson innovations for less than #12 and the second costs me !17-18 from amazon.<br />The reflective materials on the back of the neckband, over time will wear off.<br />The headphone looks really decent, good (my standard and i am happy with the degree of intensity of the mechanical wave near my ear-drums) sound, golden (not gold) 3.5mm jack and comfortable. It's not that comfortable to fall asleep with but for everything else 5 stars.<br />However, because of the life and that it costs a lot less in other parts of the globe, 2 stars.<br />(i was careless about the photos)",2015-08-30

They are super comfortable with the flexible ear holder things and fit nicely into my ear. The set up blue tooth is super easy too. The problem is that after a day, the remote failed. I tried resetting the headphones and resting my iPhone but it didn't work. The remote just crapped out which kind of sucks when you're running and want to skip a song or lowere/higher the volume. I exchanged them for another pair at Apple. After literally 3 hours the remote crapped out again. I as really mad so I went back to the Apple Store the same day and exchanged them for another brand that was $99. Well....the remote worked the the sound quality of the other brand kind of sucked and they were really uncomfortable, I decided that comfort fit and sound quality was more important than the remote so I exchanged them for another pair of powerbeats.

When i heard the sound i was pleasantly surprised. The sound was strong and it seemed like i had made a good decision to buy it. Within about 20 days, i heard some noise, popping, crackles that were not loud but enough to concern me. I should have sent it back but i did not. I don't listen to it but about 2 times per week and it didn't happen all the time. I decided it might be the music. The sound was very good at times so i was okay. As time went on, i heard it more but again did nothing which is my fault. I was not systematic in trying to figure it out like i should have been. Again, i only use it twice a week for 2-3 hours. As time proceeded, i noticed it more often and finally in the last month it has been very bad with the snap, crackle and pop! I finally tried the devices on other docking systems and did not hear any abnormal sounds. It was so irritating i called the Philips website for help because the manual i got with the device is so inadequate. The person that i was connected with was nice but she said it was the speakers probably and the warranty was expired so she could not help me. She also said the model was 2011 as if that was supposed to explain its poor function. I have products that i have bought from Samsung and Sony that were 15 years old and work perfectly. I took a chance and i got burned. I would never use a Philips system again. it was not long lasting and it was ultimately a waste of my money. Please do not waste your money on Philips docking system.  I wish i had gone with systems that are tried and true. This makes me worry about other Philips products that i have worked with in the past. Avoid this product.",2015-08-30

No. But if I get it dirty, I can literally wash it off. Depends on your wants and needs, I reckon.😈 Here's the kicker......AT&T sells these at their stores. So, they're saying something.

I compared against two other small-format amplified speakers - the UE Mini Boom (retails for about $100) and a Sonos Play:1 (not really a fair comparison, since it is twice the price at $199 and not limited by Bluetooth and battery power).<br /><br />Here are my conclusions:<br /><br />For the price and size/weight it is the best sound quality I've seen in a portable bluetooth speaker.  Frankly, I expected the UE Mini Boom to stand up better by comparison, but once I tried them side-by-side (switching the exact source back and forth via the BT connection) the superiority of the JAM was obvious.  The JAM Heavy Metal had much brighter highs, fuller mid-range, and more natural/realistic bass.  Neither can produce &#34;punchy&#34; bass, but there was very little &#34;muddiness&#34; apparent in the JAM, which I could detect on kettle drum or string bass sections of big classical songs.  Listening to Steely Dan's &#34;Two Against Nature&#34; (one of my bench test recordings for audio equipment), the JAM was maybe even a bit too bright - the cymbal crashes were at times just a tiny bit harsh for my taste, but if you're someone that likes a very &#34;lively&#34; sound, this should be right up your alley.  Cranked up to full volume, both devices could hit about the same decibel level - &#34;room filling&#34; is probably a good description, but certainly not ear-crushing sonic walls of thundering music - these things are small.  Perfect for a picnic table or sitting outside with friends around the patio table.  Plenty loud enough for hanging out at the beach, but don't expect to be able to have an outdoor dance party with hundreds of people.<br /><br />How did it do against the Sonos?  Well, like I said its not really a fair comparison, but honestly it did pretty well.  The Sonos has MUCH fuller sound and is capable of about 50% more volume, but the dynamic range seemed very similar.  Considering its is half the price and as a battery-powered BT speaker is much more flexible and portable, the Jam again stood up to the comparison very favorably.<br /><br />Some other observations:<br /><br />Bluetooth pairing was very easy.  I never looked at the instructions and had the JAM paired to my iPhone 6 within about 20 seconds once it was out of the box.  Switching back and forth between the UE Mini Boom and the Jam I noticed that the Jam re-paired and began playing almost instantly, wheras the Mini Boom took about 2 to 3 seconds to reconnect and play.<br /><br />Integration to Spotify and Pandora (and the Music app on the iPhone) was consistent - the volume buttons, pause/play, and FFD and RWD buttons all worked from the Jam to send the appropriate command to the app on the phone.<br /><br />A few negatives:<br /><br />The controls on the top of the speaker are all exactly the same size and shape. In low light it is very difficult to tell which button is what without turning on a light (there are no ridges, dots, or tactile cues to help you find the power button or the volume buttons, for example).  It would be nice if they back-lit the buttons when you touch one, or at least put a dot on top of the play/pause button so that you could tell which one it is (and then can count one or two over to find the other buttons you want).<br /><br />The charging cord that comes with it is about 4&#34; long.  Seriously?  How is anyone going to find a table top that has an outlet within 3&#34; so that they can plug this in?  Plan on getting a longer micro-USB cord (luckily I have dozens laying around).<br /><br />The voice prompts for pairing, max volume, and &#34;powering on&#34; or &#34;powering off&#34; are in a very loud voice. If you have the volume on Max (which is typical for us) and then you turn off your music and forget about the Jam, it will automatically power off after 15 minutes (a nice feature).  The problem is that it will suddenly say &#34;POWERING DOWN!!!&#34; very loudly and scare the bajeezus out of you if you've dozed off or just forgotten about it.<br /><br />The packaging is another example of excessive use of plastic. It is packaged like an action figure in a stand-up hard crystal acrylic/plastic case, all of which goes into the landfill since its not recyclable in most towns.  I'd like to see more products like this packaged in simple recycled/recyclable cardboard boxes  without the glitzy shelf appeal. (at least for online sales)<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a very small and very portable player to connect to your phone or laptop via Bluetooth and have around $100 to spend, this unit appears to be a very good (if not the best) option out there.  In fact, I just gave my UE Mini-boom to my daughter to take to her college dorm room, secure in knowing that this unit produces better sound quality and is only slightly larger.other example of excessive use of plastic.

You will have better reception without these.,"I took a chance and made the mistake of purchasing 3 of these because I got a better deal on shipping.  I thought that perhaps all the bad reviews were simply from people who did not install this properly, or were located in remote areas.  Having installed this on two different outdoor antennas in two different states, attempting various combinations of installation, I got to see how they operated (DID NOT OPERATE).  With one location in an urban area 15 miles from local towers and secondary station towers located 60 miles away, and another rural location 50+miles away from the nearest towers, I have come to the conclusion that these are pure junk.  In each situation, closest stations became weaker or disappeared, while absolutely no benefit to ever solidifying signals from any distant or close stations.  Since I bought and tried 3 of these, I am convinced now that the positive reviews must have been from people hooking up their TV and antennas for the first time, or in the process of hooking this device up they tightened a cable that may have been loose, or some tested this out on a day that happened to be great reception.  In each situation that I tried these over the last few years (with different installation variations in case I was missing something), these devices significantly hindered reception.  My advice is to do yourself a favor, and don't buy these like I did, and if you did buy these, take them down and return them or dispose of them, and you will enjoy better reception without them.",2015-08-30

As you may all know, choosing a generic lamp can be somewhat risky, but definitely worth the try if you come across a lamp with solid build quality, that is besides the burning lamp smell. The color of the TV is somewhat similar to the original OEM Lamps provided by Panasonic authorized vendors on the internet, but at fraction of the cost! If you're stuck in a position where you have the big old clunky TV sitting somewhere in your house without being able to watch anything on it because the lamp has died out, then this is the lamp replacement for you. I'll list out the Pros and Cons.<br /><br />Pros<br />-This replacement lamp is basically the same thing as the OEM Lamps provided by either Panasonic or Panasonic authorized vendors.<br />-The viewing quality is a very similar to the OEM, pretty accurate color, and good responses.<br />-FRACTION of the cost compared to the other replacement lamps out there.<br />-VERY great packaging, secured by huge bubble wraps to secure the lamp.<br /><br />Cons<br />-I have to admit the first week when we've installed this in the TV, I thought the house was on fire. I've read reviews regarding to the scent of burning, but I didn't think it would be this strong; however, it's not a huge of a deal since the odor goes away within the first 2 weeks or so.<br />-The viewing quality is very similar to the OEM lamps; however the pictures seem a bit dull, but not too noticeable once you start watching on it.<br /><br />Overall, this a great buy. If you're still on the fence on buying this or the OEM version, I know how you feel, but this was actually my second time buying this lamp and so far both times have been great, no issues at all except for the burning odor. But at the fraction of the cost compared to the OEM lamps, I can't really complain. This lamp isn't perfect, butit is a great replacement if your lamp died out, also because of the burning smell I'm giving it a 4 Star.<br />I hope to buy this item again once the replacement I've bought dies out.<br /><br />I'll update this as the moment the lamp dies out.<br />Hope this helped you making your decision!",2015-08-30

It does a few things differently from the Zen, but it does all the things I want it to. It is a little annoying that the micro SD is accessed separately, but the Zen was the same way. I bought a 16 GB card and loaded it up and just use it. I use this player all the time. The battery has a long life. While the screen is small, all I do is listen to music and don't need much in the way of graphics - so it is just fine.

That is followed by the value as I see it based on the price for the performance. For the price, this speaker performs very well. The sound is not audiophile quality. If you want Bose speakers, then you have to pay Bose prices. However, my speaker had very good bass, good stereo balance (with the two speakers, you can hear the sound distinctly from each), and okay treble. The sound is slightly tinny and I do emphasize &#34;slightly.&#34; The volume is what I'd call &#34;average.&#34; It is certainly loud enough for personal use, but it's not going to blast you into the stratosphere and it isn't appropriate for projecting over a space of more than two rooms. If you need a super loud speaker, I'd recommend looking at a UEBoom.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the controls for the alarm and clock are poorly explained and frustrating to deal with. I would not count on this as an alarm clock. In fact, I wish the feature just wasn't a part of the speakers because it doesn't add substantial value and seems unreliable. Maybe you could use it if you made sure that the power never ran down and if you never needed to wake up at various times and could set it once and never do it again, but I still think it's pretty troublesome. The &#34;kitchen sink&#34; approach is never good when you are dealing with too few buttons and trying to shoehorn in multiple functions.<br /><br />The radio function, on the other hand, works pretty well, though you do have to be careful to locate it in the right spot as it has no external antenna. It's much easier to activate the FM radio than the clock and to change the channels.<br /><br />Beyond the functions and price, I also look at the form factor and footprint. This is a very nicely designed speaker which isn't too big and sits well in front of a display or T.V. It has a sleek, classy feel and the materials feel substantial. I would definitely give this a 5 star rating for design, 3 stars for sound quality, 5 for value, 4 for the radio, and 2 for the clock function.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.ubstantial. I would definitely give this a 5 star rating for design, 3 stars for sound quality, 5 for value, 4 for the radio, and 2 for the clock function.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.",2015-08-30

I have only had this a few days but I have tried to give it a good run.  Pros: The battery seems excellent. I have paused the music and left the player sitting for a full 24 hours without seeing any change in the battery. This is good since you can pause your music and do things, come back, hit pause again and be right where you left off. It could not be easier! I love that!  Small: it is nice and small, easy to stick in a pocket (or bra) and no one will see, less chance of it getting stolen.  Good sound with good earbuds.  Cons:  Instruction manual sucks...big time...at least for me.  Do not try to use Microsoft Media Player to make playlists!!! Oh. My. Gosh. I was in near tears trying to make it work. I had done this with my other MP3 players but this one...it would not transfer. Open up your music file on your computer, open your music file on your player. Make a file named what you want your playlist named, copy and paste music from pc to mp3.  I did not like the earbuds that came with it, but I also have hearing problems. The earbuds might be fine for others.  UPDATE! I sent it back. It got to where it would not stay on even when fully charged. If I shut it off,following the instructions, it would not come back on. I had to press the buttons repeatedly to get any response.",2015-08-30

The sound is certainly good and I can see why it gets great reviews on sound.

They fit my head good, no smashing of the ears or feeling tight. The ear pads are soft and conform nice. Sound is good, not perfect but good. Id prefer if they got louder and the bass hit a little harder. But over all they sound good (tested listening to various genres country/rock/EDM even this weeks top 40 so a good range of music) the bluetooth was easy to pair just turn them on and search for your device. i was able to leave my phone in our bedroom on one side of the apartment and walk to the other side without losing connection (about 25') so id say the 30' range is probably good i haven't fully tested the battery life yet but I've used them for about 6-7 hours now with out charging and it still shows the battery at half empty on my phone.<br />The build quality is pretty good too. i recently went to target to get a prescription filled and while waiting went over to check out the headphones they had. i compared these to the beats solo 2 while i was there, and i have to say the Hesh 2 feel better in your hands and on your head. the pair of beats that they had on display the adjustable part of the band was damaged from being pulled in and out while the Hesh 2 had no issues. Thats partly what influenced my purchase of these.<br />Right now also seems to be a good time to buy these. if they're not on sale still here on amazon check around and you should be able to get these for around $60",2015-08-30

I don't think this sub will shake a large living room, but that's not the point.  If you listen to music at your desk, I highly recommend this sub. Again, the combo with the a2's is the best audiophile bang for the buck I have heard.  great little sub.",2015-08-30

The writing area is small, about 1x1/4 inches, so label text must be very short and sweet.  The zip-tie lock mechanism is above the label area rather than below it, as with other labeling ties, so the thin tie and that broad label area both must be snugged around what it's attached to rather than cinching only the tie tight and the label standing clear -- this design is less of a potential problem (of sliding, for instance) with broader and fatter cords or if the tie is fixed around the plug itself.  Another review suggested wrapping the tie a couple of times before locking it to keep it snug on thinner cords, which might be helpful.  Given all that, the ties still are very servicable and inexpensive. . .100 in a bag at about half the cost of others (as of 8/2015).",2015-08-30

The fact that it can hold up for water will make it possible to use in the shower as well.<br />I have found that this speaker really works great when working in my yard as well. I like that I don't have keep my phone right next to me in order to listen to podcasts when gardening, but can keep it at a safe distance where it does not get dirty from the yard work.<br />The radio comes with a USB cord so it can be charged up. Once charged , the speaker can hold power for up to 8 hours use. There is also a hang tab that can be pulled out. This is great if you want to hang the radio on something. When you are ready to use the speaker, it is quite simple to just press down the on/off button for a couple of seconds while pare it with your cell phone. This speaker is almost the same size and an iPhone 5. Another nice benefit of this speaker is that you can actually answer the phone while using the speaker. This will come in handy when in the shower, without having to worry that I am damaging the phone the water. The sound quality of this speaker is actually quite powerful. I am impressed with how well I can hear it and from quite a distance. It also does not sound canned, like some portable wireless speakers at times do. The sound is very powerful and strong. Overall I am very pleased both with the sound and how lightweight the speaker is. This will be  perfect to bring to the beach as well when I don't have to worry about dirt and sand getting into my phone.<br />I received this item discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",2015-08-30

I have a cabinet that contains a Time Warner set top box and an Onkyo TX-NR838 receiver, and I had been operating the system with the cabinet doors open without problems.  I wanted them closed, so I ordered the repeater.  When I first installed it, everything seemed to work.  Less than one week later, the set top box would not operate when the cabinet door was closed or open.  If I turned off the repeater, it worked flawlessly with the remote.  I tried changing the transmitter module connected to the set top box (the unit included more transmitters than I needed), and it appeared to fix the problem for a short time, but within a day, again the Time Warner remote would not control the set top box using the repeater.  When I unplugged the repeater, the set top box would again work with the remote.  The Onkyo receiver seemed to work with the repeater most of the time, but there were &#34;exotic&#34; problems with it that started happening when I installed the IR Repeater.  I cannot be certain that the IR Repeater was the problem,because I am not willing to put any further effort into making it work to isolate the specific problems.  I chose to take it out, throw it away, and keep the cabinet doors open.  After I did that (took it out and again kept the doors open and used the remote to directly control the devices), everything in my system works flawlessly.

After reading the reviews I was most concerened that the mids were going to sound weak, and initially they did. After 5 days of use at various volume levels, and numerous genres of music selection, they sound decent. Sure I have heard better, but for full range speakers in this small of a pacakage, I'm impressed. The bass response is excellant. The highs were over bearing at first as well, but they also &#34;burned in&#34; after 30-40 hours of use. I have always bought new speakers with the mindset to hook them up, crank them up, and access accordingly. I am glad I reserved my judgement, ran them in, and then sat back to marvel at my investment with pride.<br /><br />I have a smaller living room, and currently only have an old 100x4 Optimus STAV-3770. That is certainly not a powerhouse of an amp, but at even intolerable volume levels there was no clipping and limited distortion. I have these running in stereo as fronts, no sub, and placed on the floor. I agree they sound richer elevated of the floor but I like the bass response they provide down low as well.

We don't need those features as our teenager is not allowed to have her iPhone upstairs in her room and this was for her. (Parents, if you struggle with the mobile device obsession as most of us do, keep them out of your kid's bedroom so you know when they are using the things. I also take my kid's to my room at night so she can't sneak downstairs and use it.) Anyhow....So far, she likes this alarm clock fine. She really likes how it starts soft and gets louder. She doesn't wake up easily but this is doing the job. (Hint: locate the clock across the room, not at the bedside so they have to get out of bed to snooze it or turn it off. Not foolproof but it mitigates the  going back to sleep issue somewhat.) Nice clean look and relatively small footprint.  Loses a star for being a little confusing to operate (for me) and  the time didn't set itself as advertised even though I followed the directions to the tee. The radio sound and tuning are average, I'd say. She doesn't use the radio much so that isn't really a concern for us.",2015-08-30

I messed around a bit with the AM and shortwave and they seem pretty good for a $20 bill. But I can get noiseless FM from 40 miles away, which is what is important to me. And once tuned to a station it locks to it all day. If you shut it off you might have to retune it, but it doesn't drift and fading, etc is minimal. And I mean all day, because I've been listening 8 hrs day for over two weeks and haven't changed the batteries yet.

With 9300 reviews and 4.5 stars, this hardly needs another review.  But I'll post one anyway.  This has got to be the fastest I've posted a review - just got this about an hour ago.  Paring was a snap - took about 3 seconds.  Works just as expected.  I find that it takes a few seconds to re-connect to the device to output the music.  Also comes with a 3.5mm connector cable if you want to use a non-bluetooth device (it's pretty short).  The micro-SD input slot is a plus.  Tried the phone feature. That works fine too.<br />Sound:  To me, for its size, the sound is fantastic.  The music fidelity is unusually good, IMO, and I'd tend to be critical on this.  Remember:  This thing is, literally, 6 inches long.  It's got a pretty hefty-feeling weight (again, for its size), which suggests to me big speaker magnets.  It weighs in at 8.8 ounces.  I'd guess this is what helps deliver the good sound.  No, you're not going to get sound like on a 5 channel surround system, or even like on a full size quality stereo, OK, but you try this for 30 bucks or whatever it was, and see what you think for a bluetooth speaker that can go anywhere, plus phone capability, plus a micro SD port.

The USB plugs are well made and plug in securely to the outlet.  No falling out, falling partially out, hanging from the wall...  Keeping them in the storage case, and the storage case in the hall closet, gives a central location for everyone to charge so we aren't loosing track of the plugs.  At least I think that's how it will work.  We'll see.

When I tried it out I was pleasntly surprised by the speaker clarity, not what you would expect from a small speaker like this. In terms of the speaker itself it is really easy to hook it up to your phone via bluetooth and it will beep when your device is connected. The speaker also has a good battery, that does not run out quickly, but when it does It is easy to charge it. I looked at other brands but I decided to go with this one because of the price and the positive reviews. If you are second guessing whether or not to buy this speaker, do it. You will not regret it.<br /><br />I also recommend getting the Caseling Hard Travel Bag for your DKnight speaker.

I viewed a lot of products, read a lot of reviews and decided to go for the August EP636 and to date I'm not disappointed, I'm quite pleased and satisfied.

I've owned a lot of headphones including Beats Monster Mixr and this product is comparable or better than my Beats which now takes a back seat. This August EP650 is amazing, the design, comfort, sound and price could easily fetch two to three times the current retail value. First, the design is really sleek and modern, comfort, except for the crisp clear sound it's like wearing nothing, the clamp is not too tight so I can wear it for a long time unlike other headphones I have to remove after an hour or so and the over the ear profile on the 650 adds even more comfort, and the sound, OMG simply AWESOME, the clarity on these headphones is among the best I've heard, the bass is very decent yet the mids and highs is not sacrificed as with my Beats Mixr. The wired option on this product in case you've utilized eight hours of playback in one go after it's fully charged is a huge factor. So for I've got six of my friends to purchase this product and the too are very pleased with the purchase, would rate this product six+ stars if a higher rating was available.

The insides are good quality also, they disc sleeves don't break when you stuff a CD and liner notes.

I do 'shove' them in there and the sleeve does not break and it holds up! But the discs do end up super super snug but not damaged in any way.

Unfortunately, these headphones do not meet my expectations. The headphones feel extremely cheap but that didn't make me think these headphone wouldn't be great. As soon as I plugged these into my headphone jack, I could only hear sound in one ear. I thought maybe they were not plugged in all the way but they were. I twisted the TRS connector while in the headphone jack and I could hear the music being played in only the left or right ear, keep twisting and I could hear nothing but static. As I was twisting the TRS connector, I felt as if I was trying to open a combination lock. Once I found the perfect spot, the headphones sounded amazing. But with one slight movement, the sound quality faded and I was back to trying to find that perfect spot. The only constant good thing about these headphones are the silicon ear pieces.

I can play music through my indoor stereo, but I'm much more likely to go the B route, and plug in my phone into the Lepai, and play from Spotify. It's located on the covered deck, so not worried about the weather. This was super popular at the last party, with half the crowd taking turns playing their favorite songs from their own phones. It's a very inexpensive option for this solution. The only con for me, is the very small space in which to place the speaker wire.

US,14885327,R2NN8BAC8OYYZZ,B00VR5JHVK,948839,FiiO X3-II High Resolution Music Player (2nd Generation),Electronics,4,6,8,N,Y,"Great little player, almost 5 stars","I've had this player for several months now. My old player was an iPod Classic 160GB<br /><br />The sound is clearer on the Fiio X3, I noticed the difference immediately. My earbuds are Etymotic (MC5, I think?) with the foam ear tips. I've been using the player without the EQ on (basically neutral) and there isn't a lot of bass with my configuration. Not a big deal as I listen to mainly melodic metal (power, symphonic, classic, 'hair band', melodeath, etc) and progressive rock. You would probably need earbuds/headphones with better bass, along with using the players EQ if you are going to listen to music with more bass in it. I haven't had the need to use the line/coax out yet. I understand that is for high-end headphones or if hooked up to a stereo system or speakers (via a menu in the players settings)?<br /><br />As I said, sound quality is excellent, and once I figured out you HAVE to format the micro SD card while in the player (takes all of like 5 seconds) for your computer to recognize the player, it was easy to download my music library (mp3 at 320) thru Windows Media Player. Just click the 'sync' tab, drag and drop what tunes or albums you want, then hit 'start sync' button. Easy.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The player only has a 10 hour battery life fully charged, while listening thru my earbuds. My iPod Classic was more like 16+ hours…<br /><br />Unless I'm doing something wrong, you can't random shuffle through-out the entire micro SD card. I go to settings, select 'shuffle', go back to music&#62; micro sd card&#62; artist&#62; album&#62; track , and only then can I press 'play', and then it only shuffles thru that artists tracks. So for instance, if I have 10 Dream Theater albums loaded to the card, plus 500 other albums, and I go to music&#62; card&#62; Dream Theater&#62; Awake (album)&#62; 6:00 (song name), and then press 'play', the Fiio X3 will only shuffle thru the 10 Dream Theater albums, and not the other 500 albums.<br /><br />If there is a way to shuffle thru everything, I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Update: Also very hard to read the screen in bright sunlight. Even shading the screen with my hand, turning so the sun is behind me, etc. I almost can't read it. I use the player while walking for exercise a lot, so something also to consider.ay to shuffle thru everything, I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Update: Also very hard to read the screen in bright sunlight.

I bought this receiver to replace my Sony STR-DG910, which after a recent 4K TV purchase (Samsung UN55JU7100 - great TV btw) I decided needed replacing so as to have HDMI 2.0 support through my receiver.  I've been meaning for at least a year to get a newer receiver so as to have better network capabilities for streaming purposes, and so glad I waited until now to ensure the HDMI 2.0 support.<br /><br />Setup of this receiver couldn't have been easier.  I was surprised to find so little printed documentation included (a few disclaimer pages, a one page quick setup guide and a CD is included with electronic docs, but I downloaded the owners manual from the Yamaha site to ensure I had the latest copy).  The printed one page quick setup guide that was included was sufficient for the initial setup, for which I used the included YPAO microphone to ensure my 7.1 speaker system was synchronized properly.  One issue that I did have was that my XBOX One initially had no Video/Audio, but after replacing the stock HDMI cable that came with the XBOX One all was back to working.<br /><br />The options that I love in this receiver are: 1. Bluetooth support, 2. streaming support from a DLNA server, and 3. great free iPhone app.  I initially started streaming mp3s to the receiver from my iPhone (which worked great), but thought why not stream directly from my home server where all my music is stored.  I tried three different DLNA server software products: TVersity, Plex and Serviio.  TVersity was good, but was not free, Plex didn't seem to offer the ability to view my music in the folder structure I have it in, only by Artist, Album, etc, and Serviio was much like TVersity, only free (hence my choice to use Serviio).  Regarding the iPhone app, it gives a lot of the functionality of the remote control, though could use some updates just to make it more user friendly and perhaps a better aesthetic (but for free, I'm not complaining!).<br /><br />Two things I'd like to see improved:<br /><br />1. Please allow the removal of unused Inputs.  I hate scrolling through more Inputs than I'm actually using, so giving me the option to remove some unused Inputs when scrolling through the available Inputs would be well received by me.<br /><br />2. Ability to upload Wallpapers to the receiver - there are only two included, one a Piano and two is simply a Gray screen.  Not a biggie, but I imagine this shouldn't be too difficult.<br /><br />Overall this receiver was one of the best electronics purchases I've made in years.  I highly recommend it and hope this review helps :)",2015-08-29

Rubbing alcohol and microfiber towel is better option.,"These wipes are terrible. They leave behind a bunch of lint, which is most unhelpful when you're trying to clean up your phone before applying a screen/back protector. I would only recommend using them if you have some real grime build up to remove from your computer/phone/tv screen, something that calls for a little dampness to get off. You'll definitely want to follow up with a microfiber cleaning cloth after using these, to remove all that darn lint the wipes left behind on your device. I think they do dry alright, didn't have much streaking left on the back of my Edge+ phone, but the lint is a real headache and deal killer for me. Also, the dispenser is poorly designed. It's way too big of an opening, and you have to manually tear off a wipe (then push the other dozen that came up with that wipe back down into the canister). I purchased my can of these at Meijer for $4.99, surprisingly a bit cheaper than the Amazon price. For 5 bucks, 70 wipes seems like a good deal, but these in the end, are not worth the purchase.

A few months back, I borrowed a pair of Bose QC25's from a friend and loved the noise canceling feature. That was when I decided I wanted a pair with noise cancelation in the first place. But I was put off by the high price tag on the Bose, so I began to look online for alternatives. When I read reviews for the ATH-ANC9's, people said that Bose still beat out Audio-Technica with noise canceling technology, so I was worried that they wouldn't bring me the same satisfaction that the QC25's did, but boy was I happy to be wrong. Other reviewers are right, Bose definitely still holds the edge on noise canceling tech, but after owning them for a few weeks, I actually prefer the ATH-ANC8's overall. The noise cancelation is still fantastic, maybe at 90% of what Bose has in their QC25, but honestly the overall sound quality itself was significantly better on these headphones compared to the Bose.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good pair of noise canceling headphones at a reasonable price with great sound quality, these are the headphones for you.",2015-08-29

(Press...wait 10 seconds...no picture, press again...wait...etc.).  I had a problem with the audio, but it was because I had to change the output on my Dish box and it was fixed.  So now HDMI goes out from Dish, to an X-Box, then out of the X-box to the YPbPr cables to my old, giant, but super HD picture now TV.  Old TV only has YPbPr connections, and there was no way to hook up an X-box to it with HD quality until getting this.

Now it has clear 1080p definition, so it lives again with this awesome little box.<br />Works GREAT.

At first, I thought the music coming from a car that was passing by.  Imagine my surprise when my buddy pulled this out and I realized the music was coming from that?!  Holy cow.  I was sold!  I went to Best Buy to check it out.  That's when the reality set in.  I paired my iPhone to this speaker and upon closer inspection, I found the bass sound very muddy.  I'm not an audiophile by any means, but even I was able to detect this flaw.  As so happens, the Sony products were displayed next to it SRSX33 was sitting nearby.  I didn't really pay any attention to the Sony before but I figured, why not try it?  At this point, I was reserved to not buying the Bose after all.  So I paired my iPhone with the Sony and and was pleasantly surprised to find the sound coming from it to be clearer and tighter than the Soundlink Color.  And this from a smaller, more compact product and cheaper to boot.  At this point it was a no-brainer.  The quality of the Sony sold me.  (Disclaimer:  I also compared the Soundlink Mini II against this Sony and found the Mini better in all aspects.  However, at twice the price.  If you have $200 to burn, get the Soundlink Mini II.  If you want to keep it around $100, the Sony SRSX33 is a solid winner).",2015-08-29

Bose has said they have done nothing to the audio quality versus the original version, and that seems to be the case.  No better; no worse.  I'm only doing this review to mention that I had also bought the Denon Envaya Mini, which many reviewers thought as superior to this.  At first, I thought that was true; the bass is more controlled on the Envaya, but, I've grown to believe it also lacks the richness and fullness of the Bose.  The leg up for the Denon is that it is a lot lighter and has a nice shape/design to it.  I will keep both, but I see the Bose sticking around the house and the Denon hitting the road with me.  That's to be seen, though.  They're both really excellent speakers, though the Denon is a fair amount cheaper.  Bit of a tough call between the two, but I'm with the Bose overall.",2015-08-29

It is metal and feels sturdy and reliable in the hand. I had it set up and running smoothly in a couple of minutes. Video was passed through perfectly. Audio also came through clearly and reliably.<br /><br />I anticipated that normal HDMI would do just fine as it did, so I decided to up the game a notch and connect my Airtame wireless HDMI dongle to it to see how it handled that (see picture). It was surprisingly flawless, delivering exactly the same presentation and video quality I would expect from the dole being connected to the TV directly. With both the Airtame and a normal HDMI cable connected, I experienced no lag between audio and video. I am very impressed by this unit.<br /><br />To test audio, so far, I have used only the 3.5 mm input connected to my over-the-ear headphones.<br /><br />Some things to note:<br />- It does NOT come with an HDMI cable. You will need an additional HDMI cable in order to use this with your current display.<br />- It DOES come with a 3.5 mm-to-RCA audio adapter, which is very convenient if that is what you need to connect it to your audio system.<br />- It WILL still deliver audio via HDMI, so if you have a speaker on or connected to your TV/monitor, you'll still hear it from there. This was confusing for me at first, and I assumed it was not delivering audio via the audio jack.<br />- It successfully delivers clear audio, but at a relatively low volume. There is no built in amplifier or volume control (although you can control volume from the audio source). I would recommend this be plugged into an amp or receiver before going out to speakers or even headphones. To be perfectly honest, the low volume of the audio output coupled with the fact that it still delivered audio via the outgoing HDMI had me thinking for the first several minutes that the audio out did not work at all. Thus, the deducted star.<br />- You only get ONE unit (not 2, as currently pictured)<br /><br />I tested it at work today, but I'm really looking forward to using it at home with my computer monitor (no built-in speaker) for those times when I want to watch movies at my home workstation with headphones.pictured)  I tested it at work today, but I'm really looking forward to using it at home with my computer monitor (no built-in speaker) for those times when I want to watch movies at my home workstation with headphones.",2015-08-29

US,30093411,R2MPWSTSX8WDOP,B00OUAIYRC,969968780,SHARKK® Bluetooth Speaker Set Surround Sound Stereo Wireless BoomBox Buddy Speaker with 18+ Hour Playtime,Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,Impressive,"I spent many hours researching Bluetooth speakers before purchasing these. I also purchased a popular waterproof Bluetooth speaker (slightly larger than the Sharkk) at the same time as these  I waited approximately 30 days to write my review so that I would have enough time to write a valid review of this product. My background is that of a college educated project manager. Music is a hobby of mine, and although I don't consider myself a true audiophile, I know enough about music to know what sounds good and what doesn't. I have a couple thousand invested in my home audio system, which is probably better than average. I have not received any compensation for this review.<br /><br />  My first impression when receiving these speakers,  was  that they were presented and boxed beautifully in a thick cardboard box with foam cut out to hold and protect each speaker. The box they came in is nice enough to keep as a storage place for the speakers when they are not being used. In regards to sound,  I was not sure what to expect based on the size of these speakers. Although these are probably on the larger side for Bluetooth speakers, they are still quite small compared to regular speakers.<br /><br />  From personal experience, I can tell you that  that quality speakers are heavier than  inferior speakers, and these little guys have a very satisfying weight, feeling very dense and substantial when held. They have the feel of a couple of small bricks. The front and back have a perforated screen that feels solid, and the other four sides are made of what feels like a smooth, hard,  rubber like plastic. It has a very comfortable feel to it, and looks like it could take some abuse and still be okay.<br /><br />  The speakers came with a quick start guide, which was pretty easy to follow. In under five minutes,  I had the speakers paired to my Samsung galaxy 3 (and each other)and was listening to Spotify.<br /><br />  First impression was, wow. Really...wow. To hear the amount of sound, and the quality of sound, coming from these speakers-I will just say that they surprised me. I had read all of the reviews for these and other Sharkk speakers, but I still wasn't prepared for what I heard. I had read other reviews stating that the speakers sounded incredible, and could play loud, but these statements don't really do the Sharkk speakers justice. No written review does. You have to hear them for yourself.<br /><br />  In listening to these speakers, I was very surprised at the mid and high level response and clarity that is achieved. Although, these speakers don't have the &#34;thump&#34; that a sub has, and may even lack some of the lower frequency response that a larger driver offers, I find that I don't miss it. My computer speakers are Klipsh and have a subwoofer that could rattle the windows on a different floor of my house if I let them-and the klipsch have a very good high and mid response as well, but I find myself choosing to listen to these instead of my Klipsch computer speakers. Why you ask? The clarity and precision of sound presented by the Sharkk brings something different and unique to my music. Really good speakers will present sounds and detail that poor speakers cannot. With these speakers, I can hear fingers sliding on strings on a well recorded acoustic song. I can hear the cowbell (more cowbell) that was unheard and unnoticed before. I can clearly hear words I previously had not been able to understand. The Sharkk speakers bring you crystal clarity and do so effortlessly. Don't get me wrong, there are times I want to hear the &#34;thump&#34; of a sub; but there are just as many times (or more)  that I want to hear these speakers and their take on things. As far as volume, these little guys will get as loud as you need them to. If you are wanting them to produce the volume of sound achieved by a home audio system with regular speakers (meaning bookshelf or stand speakers), you have unrealistic expectations and will be disappointed. They will produce a volume level that can be comfortably  heard several rooms away in a house and also make your neighbors complain if you live in an apartment.-and the quality and precision of music produced at that level will be very enjoyable.<br /><br />The waterproof speaker I purchased cost approximately half of one of these speakers, and although it sounds good, it really is about half the speaker when it comes to sound. The Sharkk is a far superior speaker, and worth much more than the price charged. I looked at more expensive speakers, but can honestly say that I'm completely satisfied with these. Also, the surround sound and stereo benefit of these is remarkable; and you can easily carry these around the house from room to room while listening to them-or outside. Although other reviews stated that the &#34;B&#34; speaker would &#34;drop&#34; its connection and need to continuously be paired, I have not had a problem with this, making me wonder if the manufacturer has corrected this problem or if I just got lucky with mine. Even if it did lose its connection occasionally, its very easy to pair the speakers and this would not deter me from buying these again.<br /><br />Things I really like about these speakers: Quality of sound, voice/phone answering ability, ease of pairing, sound quality, stereo and surround ability, small portable size, quality of build, long battery life and ability to play/pause, choose next or previous track, and adjust volume from the speakers.<br /><br />Things I find annoying: default noises and sounds from speakers are loud and can be slightly obnoxious. If I wish to raise the volume level of the speaker, and I've reached  its maximum, it will make a very loud error type of double beep that I hate. This can happen frequently, as many times your input volume from your phone or tablet may be turned down low and if you choose the speaker volume controls to increase volume it can easily reach its maximum. I have also grownto dislike the weird sounds these speakers make when I turn them off. No other speaker makes sounds like this, I don't understand whey these have to draw so much attention to themselves. I want them to be an extension of my music playing device, not draw attention to themselves by making add noises that are loud and somewhat obnoxious. I also don't like the amount of volume that is increased or decreased using the speaker volume buttons. one single press of the volume up button can be the difference between too quiet and too loud. The volume control of your input device (my Samsung)  is much more precise. Although these things are annoying, they would not prevent me from purchasing the Sharkk speakers again, or recommending them to a friend or family member. One other item to note is that these speakers are not made for burying in the sand at the beach, or for leaving outside in the rain. They should be kept safe. If you want speakers that can hold up to these things, there are less expensive speakers that can live up to these demands, although they will not sound as good.<br /><br />In summary, I am highly satisfied with these speakers. They truly raised the bar for what a Bluetooth speaker can sound like; and they provided this level of quality at a fraction of the price that the  brand name speakers cost. It is unnecessary to spend more for quality blue tooth speakers. It is important, however, to consider the environment you will be using these, as some other Bluetooth speakers may be more resistant to rough conditions. If you are looking for a pair of Bluetooth speakers that can be moved around your house and even go outdoors with you while providing great sound and high quality, these are probably a pretty safe bet for you.",2015-08-29

The mids and highs are solid (probably a B and B+ grade, respectively), but the bass isn't as deep or prominent as I'd like. I'd give the bass a C/C- on the whole. It's a B/B- when it's mostly highs and lows, but it gets absolutely drowned out by the mids when there's more than a couple things going on. So the CX 300 IIs are good for hip-hop, but definitely not recommended for rock and its variants. I tried to EQ it every which way, switch mp3 players, switch the rubber things, but no matter what I do it's just not working out. I can't get a nice boom from rock music without turning the volume up to ear-shattering levels.<br /><br />Design-wise, they're alright. No issues here, except the plug is kind of gigantic, so it might get all bent up in your pocket.<br /><br />These phones compare unfavorably to the discontinued Pioneer SE-CL721-K, which are the best I've ever had never having spent above $60. The CX 300 II frequency response is a relatively weak 42Hz - 17kHz in comparison to the Pioneers, which are 5Hz - 23kHz. I didn't think it would be that big a difference to my non-audiophile ears but it totally is. I'm 100% sure there's better value out there for earphones under 50 bucks.",2015-08-29

It will be perfect for that application.  The aluminum case, volume knob, and power button have a nice quality feel to them.  The bass and mids sound good, while the treble is decent yet lacking in clarity in comparison to my Tripath amplifier.  4 1/2 stars for presentation, and 3 1/2 for sound.  I bought this amp wanting to try the TDA7492 class D amplifier chip.  I had initially decided on the PartsExpress / Sure Electronics 2x50w amplifier board, but after considering the added cost of power supply, and lack of volume knob, I went with the SMSL for about the cost of the Sure amp board and power supply.  That's right, for a comparable price you gain the volume knob, power switch, and a nice looking case.  I have a Dayton DTA-1 (Tripath amplifier) driving some Infinity Primus 6.5&#34; bookshelf speakers (P163s, fairly sensitive at 90dB @1W,1m) and had to compare the two amps.  For the SMSL, power-on was quiet, but right away I noticed an elevated noise floor in absence of source.  The noise continued into quiet portions of music, but was not distracting at moderate or strong program levels.  The SMSL is significantly more powerful than the Dayton (which is expected given its rating of 50W RMS vs 15 for the Dayton).  The bass was stronger and the midrange seemed a little &#34;warmer&#34; than the Dayton, but for percussion there was a lack of detail and clarity that I have become accustomed to hearing from these speakers.  My 2-way Yamaha outdoor speakers will appreciate the extra power of the SMSL, and won't miss the clarity of the Dayton since they don't exhibit the same clarity as my Infinity speakers when driven by the Dayton amp.  See my images for a peek at the internals.  As Adam says below, there are 3x2200uF filter capacitors = 6600uF.",2015-08-29

I have not experienced failure yet, and they appear as if they would continue &#34;snap&#34; on anyway, but the &#34;hinge&#34; that allows the cap to open and close is extremely thin plastic (like the rest) and will wear out with its repeated flexing.  Since the caps &#34;snap&#34; on securely (obviating the need for the hinge to have to last long), when opening you can end up putting extra stress on the little hinges as you &#34;pop&#34; the cap off. [this is a minor con]<br />(2) the cases are not marked with &#34;+&#34; and &#34;-&#34;.  I am one who needs to *always* check which way batteries go in *everytime* even for cameras etc., and I highly value the little symbols in battery compartments showing which way the flat end it supposed to point.  With those missing here, i used an indelible ink pen to mark each case. Of course, the shape of the case suggests which end of the smaller battery you are putting inside should be pointed which way, but this requires an assumption that both batteries point the same way inside and mirror the outside of the case, which younger children to whom the task may be delegated will not always make.<br /><br />I am not rating full stars, simply b/c these are *really* cheap plastic and I feel a little ripped off at having to pay even the little that i did to obtain them!  Yet I would strongly recommend these to folks who rely largely on smaller rechargeable batteries, and I will not hesitate to buy more of these if I have need of more larger batteries",2015-08-29

My husband likes that these are a solid black color instead of a mix of colors or black with a bright color like neon green, pink, etc. like some of the other sports headphones. We actually had a previous model that he enjoyed, but when I got these he handed them over to me to claim this pair. The music sounds really good giving him something to listen to while he is working out. These are not water proof but are sweat proof so that he can wear them while working out which is important because he sweats a lot and has killed a few other sets of both cordless and corded earbuds from the sweat. So far these ones are keeping up with him and not having any issues.<br /><br />He likes that they come with a clip that you can decide if you want to attach or not so that he can clip them to the collar of his shirt just in case he needs to take them out and let them hang around his neck while talking with people. They are very lightweight and sit in his ears without hurting them or weighing heavy on them.<br /><br />They connect quickly and easily to both his iPod touch Gen 3 (though we tested them with my Gen 4 and my sons Gen 5 and they connect fine with those as well) and his Samsung Tab 3 10.1 tablet. The last pair we had didn't have much for markings on the earbuds themselves and he is glad that with this model they decided to mark the power button so you can quickly see where the on/off switch is without having to tap around on both sides trying to figure out and remember how to power them on and off.",2015-08-29

Your device volume changes the Bluetooth volume - but not for the full range of the amp's volume - so it is tricky to retain the right volume span when I switch between my phone and Roku (since my phone volume is always changing). Griffen says put your device volume at 50%.  Doing that each time is a pain.  4. You can't play anything analog.

The mic attaches with a magnet onto the base, and you can flip the angle to a different position so that it doesn't have to be in your face all the time. The clips provided would work well with a straight cabled headphone, however I am using them with a coiled cable headphone and it is a bit of a mess, I will likely change to a straight cable to help with this problem. The mic only outputs a strong signal when spoken directly into, but you can generally get it close enough to your mouth to capture usable audio. It is possible to clip the signal if addressed directly.

The screws that came with the mount for attaching to the wall were 100% perfect for attaching to a stud.  Which raises the point addressed in other reviews, where I will ask: WHY IN YOUR RIGHT MIND WOULD YOU INSTALL A FLAT SCREEN TV, WEIGHING DOWN A HORIZONTAL TV MOUNT, ADDING SHEARING GRAVITATIONAL FORCE TO THE EQUATION, *ONLY* TO DRYWALL!?!? If you're installing a TV wall mount - *ANY* TV wall mount - install it in a stud. They're only 18&#34; apart and these types of TV mounts will easily span that difference in adjustability. There is just no logical reason whatsoever to use drywall alone. DRILL IN TO A STUD, PEOPLE!  It did take a while for me to install, probably about 2 hours - but that was complicated because I didn't notice that the mount could be adjusted for horizontal tilt just by adjusting the top two TV screws, and I kept trying to get the mount centered on the wall. Lesson learned for your advantage: the mount does NOT need to be perfectly level on the wall when you screw it in. There is probably about 5, maybe 10 degrees of adjustment built in to the part where the TV is attached to the mount, by loosening the top two bolt heads, lining the TV up, and tightening them back down.  Because it was my fault for not noticing that adjustability, I can't subtract any points from the unit review. User error all the way. Once I got it tightened down (by the way, I used a shim between the mount and the wall to introduce about a 10 degree downward angle, so the TV is easier to see from our bed - it worked perfectly!), this unit lived up to well beyond what we paid for it.  Short story: 100% recommended.",2015-08-29

Muffled sound.,"I feel bad rating this a one star because the features on paper are all there. I had high hopes on the comeback of RCA Company via Audiovox's 808 branding to appeal to the young generation.<br /><br />However it turns out that it's more of a gimmick.<br /><br />WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:<br /><br />- The rotating earcups do nothing really that a well built flexible headphone band can do. In fact it's more cumbersome to rotate than to simply remove from your ear and reposition just like you normally would. It ended up a bit annoying.<br /><br />- The ear cups provide mediocre fit to my average sized ears. It's too round and not big enough. Needs to be more oblong in shape for a better fit and sound isolation.<br /><br />- The silicone padding is unique which I welcome and say kudos on this innovative application but it's too thin that I can feel the metal headband pressing down. Needs to be thicker for more padding.<br /><br />- The sound is horrible. It just was muffled from the highs to the mids that the low end becomes prominent. It's like someone took an equalizer and dialled down the highs and dialled up the bass.<br /><br />- Flimsy cord with fat ends that wouldn't fit my iPhone with a case. I like that it uses generic connectors and has a non-tangling feature, but my more expensive headphones uses fatter cables but has a thinner end connector so it fits even with a case.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:<br /><br />- The floating speaker concept is an interesting application that I feel deserves better. It provides better isolation from the headband. Too bad the actual speaker doesn't deliver to back up the design.<br /><br />- The metal headband I really love. It's minimalistic and authoritative at the same time that the height adjustment clicks with finesse.<br /><br />- The silicone padding is a great first I've seen and is so easy to clean and replace. But it's too thin my head hurt from the headband pressure.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />For the listed price the fit and finish is actually very good. I wanted to love this headphone and use as an everyday gear but the moment I put it on my ear and started a familiar music that I listen through studio quality monitoring headphones as well as studio monitor speakers that are of different brands but sound very similar, this 808 just played a different tune altogether. It's so bad it stood out.<br /><br />And in the end no matter the material and build quality. You buy it for the sound quality and I sadly can't recommend it even at this price.nd finish is actually very good.

MUST READ DESPITE REVIEWS","I initially purchased these AA batteries for emergency LED lanterns. Well I had some previously purchased lanterns that I loved.....stayed on for 48 continuous hours with Eneloop batteries. I wanted to buy a few more for my parents in case of a power outage, so I found the LED lanterns still available here on Amazon and bought four more.  This time around though I opted for these EBL batteries to save some dough$$$.<br /><br />The lanterns and batteries arrived and of course I proceeded to check each lantern, after all they (Lanterns) come on a LOOOOONG boat ride from CHINA in a padded envelope.  Well, test one.....fail to light.......test another..... fail to light........test last one and get a flash when shaking it( we all know that when something will not work the logical thing to do is shake it, tap it, rap it on the counter or if all else fails....hit it with a hammer)  all jokes aside, I being mechanically inclined (we are talking about installing batteries here folks...I got  this!!!) had to figure out why.<br /><br />I looked and analyzed the battery compartment of the Lanterns.....all seemed well.  upon closer examination I noticed that the metal positive contacts were not dimpled far enough out to contact the positive nub on the EBL battery,  OR SO I THOUGHT!!!! I tried an eneloop, an Energizer and a Duracell all functioned flawlessly.  So, what gives????<br /><br />I took out my digital calipers and compared EBL to the Eneloops. (SAMPLE OF 6 Each and then averaged them out.<br /><br />Overall length  of Eneloop.....1.975&#34;<br />Overall length of EBL.............1.969&#34;<br />Overall height of positive nub off the top of the cell  Eneloop.......  .064&#34;<br />Overall height of positive nub off the top of the cell  EBL.............  .038&#34;<br />Overall diameter of cell Eneloop.......  .555&#34;<br />Overall diameter of cell EBL..............  .564&#34;<br /><br />Problem solved.... the positive nub protruding from the top of the battery is so GROSSLY out of spec, that it will not make contact the with any devices' terminals I tried these in. Way too short.  Also as other reviewers mentioned they will be snug fitting or not fit at all in some devices due to the fact that  they are larger in diameter than other batteries as well, so if you have a device that requires 4 -6-8 of these grouped together in the battery compartment the problem multiplies exponentially.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch? They should not have passed quality control.<br /><br />Amazon was very helpful and sent out prepaid return label, but BEWARE, it may not be a dead battery as so many others wrote in their reviews but a lack of contact with the devices terminals due to the positive nub being so short along with overall length being shorter as well.<br /><br />I have to say that the seller, AIBOCN, contacted me immediately after seeing my request for a return and offered a full refund all expenses paid return but Amazon did the refund anyway as I contacted them first.  The seller also stated that they were going to contact the manufacturer as well to make them aware of the short battery and terminal lenght.  Cant complain about their customer service a bit.

The battery lasts a long time,but that is probably because it doesn't consume energy putting out quality sound.

This MP3 player is OK. Not a fan of how you have to maneuver through the menus. But any one spoiled by touch screen and iPod's will not be thrilled with this. As for me. I use it as a back up music device for when my phone is about dead. And for that.. it's great. The mini SD port is one asset this thing has. So it is convenient to have my entire song library all with in something smaller than my clenched fist. So over all. I give it a 3/5. I personally wouldn't have spent more than $15 on it had I experienced it first. I hope this review helped. -ian",2015-08-29

The headphones that I have come from are the Beats by Dr. Dre Pro so I will be comparing them to these.  Before I bought these on Amazon I first purchased the Sennheiser HD800s.  I had an amp to pair them with, the JDS Labs Element, and I absolutely did not like the HD800s.  Their sound signature was not to my liking.  I decided to send them back and get the Sennheiser HD700s instead because they were over $1000 cheaper and I thought their sound quality to cost ratio would be better.  I actually did like them better than the HD800s but I still did not find them enjoyable when compared to the Beats Pro.  I decided to send the HD700s back as well.  At this point I had given up on &#34;audiophile&#34; headphones thinking that none of them supplied the bass that I had enjoyed from the Beats Pro.  That's when I had read many different reviews of Hifiman's He-400s.  Everyone was talking about their sound quality and how their bass was so good while still keeping that &#34;audiophile&#34; sound signature.  I decided to give them a shot, especially since they were only $249.  I was blown away!  The treble is very crisp and very clear.  Their mids are solid.  The bass is the best I have heard, very clear, and nothing gets in the way.  What brought me to these was that every review I read compared them to the Audeze LCD2 and how they had so much bass.  I am 100% satisfied and I recommend these to everyone.  They are light years ahead of the Beats Pro even though they cost less.  The Beats Pro has the bass, but I never realized how much they overpowered all the other frequencies.  I now find myself lowering the bass output on all of my sound systems because I have never known what music should have sounded like before I found these.  Everyone reading this review should without hesitation buy these.  I guarantee you'll love them.",2015-08-29

They kind of &#34;sit on top&#34; of my ears; they don't really have much squish/give.  Kind of like those sort of stiff vinyl toilet seats?  Best comparison I can think of.

I was looking for something to wear on walks and at the gym so I can keep my phone in my bag or in my pocket without a wire running across my body.  I initially was looking at headphones that are over $100 but decided to give these a try given the attractive price.  These headphones have been great.  At such a light weight, they have been amazing to use in the gym.  The cord is short enough that it does not get in the way during squats.  The built in control allow you to play/pause and forward/back but does not allow change of volume-no biggy.  The microphone is clear and can pick up my voice well even when I am in the gym.  The range is actually longer than described so you don't even need to stay close to your phone.<br />These earphones were so great I purchased a second pair so I leave one pair in my gym bag and another to use for everyday activities.<br />At this price, you can break or lose 5 pairs before breaking even with a pair of $100 BT earphones.

One of the recommendations was the the Kanto brand.  I first started off with portable wireless for the master bedroom using bluetooth (for iPad for Netflix or Spotify music, etc).  Some of the one's I head-to-head compared were:  Soundlink 3, Soundlink Mini II, Big Jambox, Sony x55, ROAR 2, Sonos Play 1, Marshal Acton, Amazon Echo.  The bluetooth worked adequately on most portable but the sound was pretty much....horrid.  I have an audiophile system so I'm spoiled by good sound, BUT I was realistic in what could be accomplished with a portable.  Suffice to say, all of the portables were substandard with the exception of the Marshal Acton and Play One (which was quickly written off since it didn't have bluetooth or could stream Netflix or anything outside of its app).  The Bose stuff was &#34;big&#34; sounding but the sound was veiled beyond belief.  If you don't compare it to to other stuff, you might be fooled into believing that this is the &#34;best&#34; you can do in this segment...which it isn't...not by a long shot.  The Sony had bluetooth delay on videos but sounded better than the Bose stuff.  The Big Jambox was an all rounder best for such sound, but anemic enough in the bass to leave me wanting.  The Amazon Echo is a different beast and not engineered for sound, but still has a good value proposition in its promise as a toy.  The Marshal Acton.  Well now we're getting somewhere!  Finally a box that can play high, mids, lows.  It BLEW the stuff above out of the water (aside of the Sonos Play One).  Great sound.  You can tweak the bass and highs.  Plays loud.  A real winner!  Also, to be fair, the units above are more portable and battery powered.  BUT, the Marshall KILBURN is the same size of this Acton and has a battery and similar sound, so in effect, remains relevant.  Though it isn't so &#34;backpack portable&#34; as the units above...doable, but more of a slog carrying it to somewhere like the beach, which I wouldn't really do with the beautiful Kilburn in the first place!  Moving on...  Then I bought the Kantos to test out.  OK.  It's not fair.  The Marshal is a tiny boom box. Great sounding of course.  But it is what it is.  The Kantos is a different beast in that it's a stereo system.  Portable and bluetooth stil, but no battery.  But for my intended bedroom use, the FLEXIBILITY in connections is a market differentiator!  Not many of these portables can hook you up to two Optical AND has a subwoofer out and can stream bluetooth, has AUX & RCA AND can tweak the highs and lows....and has a remote!  Whoa!!!  The sound quality was crystal clear and the bass was more than enough for the bedroom (again, a different beast, but a whole other league in sound quality to the portables, aside of the Marshall and Sonos, but still inferior).  If you're a bass nut, then you need a sub, but that really is overkill as you get such a full sound, that you're not left wanting (especially if you have them against the wall to resonate).  The sound can be additionally tweaked to taste and music genre with the remote (wish it had a bass/treble knob in the back just in case you were to lose the remote...I went ahead and copied the codes onto a universal remote, just in case).  Also, the fact that they're beautiful and look distinguished on a nightstand is a another win.  I APPLAUD what the engineers and designers were able to accomplish.  They designed a speaker the same way an intelligent power user with high standards would design it.  This is a 6 star out of 5 star product as there's really not really too many that can stand up to it in terms of sound/beauty/hookability/size (they're out there, but they're also obscure brands).  I'm kind of sad that Kanto isn't more well known, as this company deservedly SHOULD be a market leader above the Bose stuff.  I had to find out about Kanto through a chat comment on an audiophile website for crissakes.  This brand should be front and center with a halo around it at the big box store speaker shelf!  On a side note, I have an optical cable tied to the Apple Airport Express router and &#34;Airplay&#34; out of my iPad for Spotify and the like, as well as Netflix and the stuff on my NAS server in the den (better sound thru WiFi than bluetooth technology folks, which is why I tied the router to it).  I have a smile ear to ear.  GREAT JOB Kanto!  I will mention your stuff on the boards to those who will listen.",2015-08-29

I did not purchase this from Amazon, but got this as part of a rewards program.  The color selected was Mint, which was the most appealing out of the colors.  If not Mint, the second choice would have been Black as it is very neutral and probably would not show dust or dirt as much.<br /><br />Sound: The most important characteristic of speakers.  In short, I enjoy the sound of this speaker.  It is loud enough for my one bedroom apartment, though it will not be shaking any walls.  It is clear, having a decent presence of treble that is on the smooth and mellow side, which I like and find not fatiguing as other speakers that have piercing treble.  It has some depth with adequate bass, that does better than most portable speakers in the compact range.  The two that outperform this speaker in full-bodied sound with deeper base are the Bose Soundlink Mini and the JBL Charge 2.<br /><br />I do own the Bose Soundlink Mini as well, which does get a bit louder, hits deeper bass notes, produces a more rich sound, and does appear to have better stereo separation.  On some songs, the difference is not as noticeable.  However, on a lot of others, especially those with any amount of bass notes, the difference was significant for both my wife and I to notice.  Now the Soundlink Mini appears to put out as much rich sound as can possibly be created from a portable compact speaker that size.  Naturally, it will not put out subwoofer type of sub-bass that a full-sized system or home theater would.  However, just to hear the Bose Soundlink Mini gives that &#34;wow factor&#34; every time.<br /><br />The Bose Soundlink Color is no slouch though. It is still impressive, and will have most thinking that it is a good speaker, especially considering the size and most of the other options available.  It does not give me quite the &#34;wow factor&#34; of the Mini, but the sound it produces is still appreciated.  If you are in the audience that does feel the Mini produces too much bass, the Color may be just right.  If you want to get more bass effect, placing the speaker within a foot of a wall will definitely provide some boost.  One thing that the Color does better than the Mini is produce better listening angles.  What this means is that if you sit directly in front of the Mini, the treble sounds good, but once you start moving to the side, the effect is not as clear.  The Color appears to keep the treble at much larger angles.<br /><br />For those people who have gave a good listen to the Bose Soundlink Color and still think the sound is still &#34;bloated,&#34; perhaps a more appealing speaker would be something like the Denon Envaya Mini which is known for its clarity.  However, my preference is towards more bass, which appears to really lack in the vast majority of these portable compact speakers, especially at lower volumes.  I wanted something something that separates itself from that and believe that the Soundlink Color is successful in this regard, with the Soundlink Mini doing it even better.  However, I am open to larger portable bluetooth speakers and am wondering if the upcoming Aiwa Exos-9 will be able to produce the subwoofer levels of bass that I crave beyond what the Soundlink Mini can produce.<br /><br />Build: The Bose Soundlink Color is plastic all around, appears durable, and well made.  The buttons have more distinctive clicks underneath the rubberized unibody-layer on the top of the speaker.  It definitely feels a lot more portable, and is lighter, than the Soundlink Mini.  The Soundlink Mini does look very high-end with the full aluminum housing.  For some reason, I find the Soundlink Color in Mint more unique and appealing, though not as high-end as the Mini.<br /><br />Performance: Most people will find the design to be very convenient.  The pairing with bluetooth devices worked overtime with ease and consistency.  That is the main thing.  The battery has been lasting easily 8 hours of off-and-on use at moderate volumes.  In addition, people will enjoy the Micro-USB charging, the ability to pause, fast forward, and back track, all of which are more convenient than the Soundlink Mini.  One thing that is missing, but is more of a wish, is that this is not water resistant.<br /><br />Overall I rate the Bose Soundlink Color a 4.3 out of 5.0 stars.  With my preferences considered, I know there is a better speaker out there (Bose Soundlink Mini) in this portable compact bluetooth speaker category.  However, it would be in the top four speakers in this category.  Others being the JBL Charge 2 and the Denon Envaya Mini.  I also hope to listen to the Aiwa Exos-9 when it comes out, but that is barely portable and far from compact.<br /><br />UPDATE July 11, 2016:<br />The Bose Soundlink Color continues to perform well.  Attached are a few pictures with a case that was also purchased on Amazon.In addition, people will enjoy the Micro-USB charging, the ability to pause, fast forward, and back track, all of which are more convenient than the Soundlink Mini.  One thing that is missing, but is more of a wish, is that this is not water resistant.  Overall I rate the Bose Soundlink Color a 4.3 out of 5.0 stars.  With my preferences considered, I know there is a better speaker out there (Bose Soundlink Mini) in this portable compact bluetooth speaker category.  However, it would be in the top four speakers in this category.  Others being the JBL Charge 2 and the Denon Envaya Mini.

This is if not, the best headphones you can buy especially when its on sale.<br /><br />1. JBL they simply give you the best quality at whatever price you pay, there is no other brand out there that gives the best you can have at any price range, many others simply give and take features JBL, says NO, we give you all we can at this price. Tbh, I feel bad for them its like im robbing them all their hard work.<br />2. The battery last forever I swear, I went almost a week without charging them, they just don't seem to ever die.<br />3. The sound, now I know sound is supposed to be number 1, but generally most headphones that are 70 dollars and over are usually quite top notch, and these are no exception, Now are you going to get extreme bass no because these are simply made for get overall quality, which it does. But at this price range, and with Bluetooth, the best you can possibly have believe me.<br />4. Material is very important. I wish they had implemented a metal band or at least a small one, that being said, is why i toke a star off. The actual speakers themselves and ear parts, are high grade. But what i can say is whatever plastic, is used, I believe it is a high density plastic because 2 months of use on a big head like mine, it shows no wear at all. The benefit of this design is because it is essentially one giant piece of durable plastic, means that unless you are trying to break them it wont happen. So the important parts are made out of the good stuff, and the rest is just to save a little money and weight. They will just simply last so long as they are not used as toys.<br /><br />Overall, best bluetooth headset at this price range, yes there might be some that that have better sound or some better design, but in general,these are just simply great headphones all there is to it.",2015-08-29

It was on a $15 refurb deal. Can't beat that! I'd been wanting to but it for a long time but couldn't justify the $50 original price, since we already had a rabbit ear antenna that worked pretty okay. The rabbit ear antenna picked up quite a few channels. The problems I had with it was having to move it when a signal faded, having to change in different directions to get different channels, and erratic signal during rain and windstorms.  The Leaf has picked up all the stations I had before, obtaining a nice steady signal. Plus we got a couple stations we never got before. One thing I still can't pick up is my local PBS station. The antenna used to pick it up and cannot now; I was expecting the Leaf to get it but it hasn't, so that is a little disappointing. I haven't seen it perform in a storm yet...we will see how that goes in the future.<br /><br />Giving this a four star. It's not perfect (expected it to pick up PBS and I did see some signal flickering last night, but nothing compared to my antenna where it used to totally lose the signal for minutes.)

Plenty of features: Music (MP3, WAV, WMA were tested), video (AMV, but i didn't test it), ebook (prepare for and interesting reading experiences, however words in any text (.TXT) format will work), games (however see below regarding menu navigation). I would venture that this player can be best utilized as a music player during long drives. Just load the music, and let it play itself. It is NOT suited for multi-task using (no music & games at the same time).<br /><br />Externals & Menu Navigation<br />It has a good screen, but for the features offered, it's just really small. eBook reading can be a frustrating experience, and I wouldn't recommend loading any videos with a quality higher than 480p. This particular version (there is a similar version sold by another company) has 5 buttons, NO trackwheel (don't let the picture fool you), and a power switch on top. My player had the switch, but the device could also be powered off by pressing & holding for a few seconds the Play/Pause button. It seems that the switch is a hard power off, and the play/pause a soft power off??? Once the device is on, I would recommend some mindful meditation or other stress relief exercise before interacting with the device. In order to scroll up/down on the device, one would press the right/left buttons (respectively), a VERY counter intuitive idea. Think that you are going to make your selection by pressing the center button? Nope! your enter key is the MENU button. To describe folder navigation is similar. For games, Menu is up, left-left, right-right, but the center button is for down.<br /><br />Firmware & Software:<br />There is no associated software. the device is glorified thumb drive, but I think that's a plus, and was a pro that gave this 2 stars. For music: device does not show cover art, but considering my suggested use, one should NOT be looking elsewhere but the road :) . Menu navigation is frustrating at first glance, but is still quasi-easy. Pressing MENU during a song will show options, but What I noticed is that if you did not go into the folder menu the first time, and you selected play options, any subsequent attempt to reach the menu will lead you back to the settings. Press & Hold menu to return to the home screen, but your music will stop playing. Ditto for videos. I cannot find a manufacturer for this device or the firmware, so no updates, and no &#34;alternative&#34; firmware options.<br /><br />Construction & USB Port<br />Another plus is that this is made of aluminum, and it actually feels like a quality product (wish i could say the same for the firmware). The power switch is on top, headphone port (no button support), lanyard port, and USB port on the bottom. A strange quirk is that we are harking back to the days of Mini USB (usually found with digital cameras) instead of micro USB (modern phones and some other electronics). this is only an issue if you plan on using other chargers or cords to interface with the device.<br /><br />Overall, i'm glad I returned it, and chose another product. This had so much potential, but the firmware issues were just too much to deal with.",2015-08-29

I am in no way affiliated with either company, and this is an unbiased review, that I wish someone else would have written.<br /><br />With headphones, when forking over serious money to a reputable Brand like Grados, Senn, Sony, etc, you will be hard-pressed to find a &#34;terrible&#34; headphone. That said, people prefer different sound signatures, different curves, unless you want a true neutral/flat sound for monitoring, which you do not get with the M50s and you sure as hell do not get with these.<br /><br />I purchased the ATH m50x and did extensive A to B testing with them and the new Studios.<br /><br />The Studios are more up-front, powerful, with fuller in-your-face mids. They sound for lively and aggressive. The M50xs have recessed mids. The mids, many would agree, are missing compared to the Beats.<br /><br />Bass - I mainly listen to hip hop..no no no don't stop reading :), I also listen to other kinds of music such as pop, jazz, some classical. I prefer the Beats in every way. Others may disagree on this front. The bass on the Beats, like many others have said, have been toned down, and have been made more refined since the first version. The bass on the m50s may be a little tights, and this may be a bit looser and a bit more boomy, but again I prefer the beats.<br /><br />The highs on both are great. They are shimmery and warm, and not overly-harsh on either of the HPs.<br /><br />I really, really wanted to like the M50s more because I got them for 89 bucks! But I would just be lying to myself. The M50s were not as FUN as the Beats. The music is colored and it is changed but trust me IT is extremely enjoyable on the Beats.<br /><br />Are you thinking of getting an amp? Well, you will NOT need one with the Beats bc it essentially has an internal amp. With the M50s, although not necessary bc of the low impedance, an amp would benefit the experience. This is another PLUS for the Beats.<br /><br />There are many at the Head-Fi forums that would agree.<br /><br />Looks: this should not play a large role, but to some it does. It terms of looks, although subjective, my personally tastes favors the Beats, although M50s have some killer colorways, and the M50x have shorter cords and are made to be more portable.<br /><br />Build: The M50x band has a little less clamp; they have updated the cushions on the M50x; the beats seem a bit tighter on the head, and I sweat easier in them vs the m50s, but just my a small bit. There are pics of horror stories on here about the Beats breaking which is VERY concerning, and I really hope that does not happen to me. it appears fairly durable. If I had to guess, though, I would say that the M50X are more durable.<br /><br />Things that are obvious: beats hit you with a higher price, beats have somewhat of a good noise cancellation.<br /><br />I really hope that this helps your decision if you are considering these two. if it matters, my best friend and wife agreed when they did BLIND tests conducted by me.<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions.",2015-08-29

NFC compatible, audio out device.<br /><br />When I opened the box, it was love at first sight as my eyes rested on the gold color headphones. The headphones felt lite but durable, the meatal along the headband give them a premium felling. It was easy to pair using NFC on my g4. I loved the ability to see the battery indicator on my phone once paired. I enjoy this feature, because it allows me to see how much juice I have left in my headphones. The leather padding on the headband and ear cups are absolutely wonderful. The Ear Cups have a swivel that allows the headphone to move with your head. As you can tell in the video the headphones was wonderful doing my workout, I had no problems, at all with them.<br /><br />The Sound in these headphones are better than other headphones I heard before, including my beats. They get super loud, while keeping the quality in sound. The bass rips off a deep thunderous vibration, that made my face shake. I'm not trying to be a fan boy here, but they are a great set of head phones",2015-08-29

I purchased this product 6F22. As a Chinese and an engineer/manager in USA, I shall say you seems to do a good job and customer service. I read through Amazon customer reviews and think there are small things you shall know to understand what customer want.<br />1. It is not clear if the  charger has over charge protection. This is what customers really care about, you spend words to talk about &#34;blue LED turn off&#34; (which is wrong, no blue LED but Red) when fully charge  . This is confusing, do you want to imply it will shut off current/stop charging when the light is off?  Then you shall SAY it.  Do you mean  if I leave the  9V battery on the charger for a whole week, it will not get over charged (and will not get drained after it shut off?)<br /><br />2. It is not clear what is cycle charge. Google this and you can't find the definition. Do you mean if I put a 50%  and a 0% batteries in the charger, the 50% will go through the draining process and then charging, while the %  battery will start charging right away?  This is critical to  NI-MH since it has memory effect.<br /><br />These are the two examples that you shall communicate better.

On paper it looks great; the receiver supports all of the latest and greatest features at a reasonable price point.  Unfortunately, it seems like they might have rushed it to market before it was complete.  The first problem occurred when I tried to run the Audyssey speaker calibration.  The process would get about three quarters of the way through and then the display would start cutting in and out ending in a 'no HDMI signal detected' message on my TV.  I retried the process multiple times each time ending with the same result.  I exchanged the unit for a new one, thinking that I had just gotten a lemon, but the same problem occurred on the second unit as well.<br /><br />The second problem that I found was a lock up when I attempted to access the receiver through its web interface.  At first things were going smoothly but then the receiver got stuck on a page and would no longer respond.  I power cycled the receiver, but it wouldn't let me access anything but the page that it had previously crashed on.  It took a hardware reset to eventually fix the problem.<br /><br />Since both problems looked like software issues, I checked to see if there was a firmware update available, but there wasn't.<br /><br />I then tried to call the Denon 800 number to see if they had any advice, but they apparently don't feel the need to have tech support available on weekends.  This seems a little short sighted to me since the majority of installations probably take place on the weekends and I bet a lot of units get returned by frustrated owners.<br /><br />On the positive side.  The audio quality from the receiver was excellent.  The unit made my speakers sound better than I ever thought they possible.  It was very impressive.<br /><br />I could have lived with the website lockup, but the speaker calibration was too important a feature not have, so I reluctantly returned the second unit and hooked up my old antique outdated Sony receiver again.<br /><br />I may have been unlucky and just hit two bad units in a row, or maybe the device just has problems interfacing with my Samsung TV, but I'm betting the real issue are software bugs that will be fixed in an upcoming release.  It's too bad.  I really liked this receiver and if had worked as advertised, I would have been very happy with it.",2015-08-29

These looked comfortable and had good reviews on sound and such,  but after I got them I'm just not very happy with them.<br /><br />The sound is okay,  but doesn't seem to get loud enough for me.  The fact that it is open back also increases this frustration as a lot of outside sounds bleeds in and makes the already hard to hear audio harder.  The cups are pretty large which was a selling point for me as I wanted around the ears for my large ears, and it does this and it is pretty soft.  However I don't see a way to replace these cups once they start going bad which means you'll eventually have to buy all new headphones (which these are not cheap to replace).  I also didn't read enough into it and found only once they arrived that they are very stationary headphones,  meaning they don't bend or twist so if you have to pull them down around your neck or put them into your backpack,  it just doesn't work.  The other aggravation is the cables,  they are ridiculously long!  That is good for studio as you might need to to maneuver around a lot of equipment and such,  but I was expecting at least one of the cables to be reasonably length for when I'm on computer, laptop, or game station.  There is enough cable that I can plug it into my phone, put the headphones on,  and skip rope with the rest of the cable.<br /><br />So before buying these headphones,  really think about what you are buying them for.  I quickly read a few strong reviews and saw they were big enough for my big ears and purchased them without thinking about the rest.  Unfortunately I also didn't get around to actually opening them and trying them out until after my 30 day return policy was already up.  If you are looking for a pair of Studio Headphones,  that will be used just for recording studio purposes,  then these could be a good option.  However if you are looking for more universal headphones that will be used for multitudes of things (gaming, listening to music on phone, computer use, travel, etc),  then I would suggest looking at other options that have more features tailored towards these things.o purposes,  then these could be a good option.

I loved everything about it except for the fact that almost immediately after first use when I used it in the shower the volume would inexplicably go down to barely audible.  If I picked it up and shook the water off, the volume would go back up.  This happened constantly during my shower.  It cost me $28.00 to send it back to Sangean.  After testing it and telling me it worked the tech admitted that he didn't test it in the shower and sent me a new radio.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN WITH THE NEW RADIO.  I'm not spending another $28 to return it. Picking it up and shaking it six times during the shower drives me crazy. I tried covering the plug (which won't stay in) with waterproof tape and it doesn't help. UPDATE:  After reading other comments I learned that the problem is that water collects on the exterior of the speaker.  If I tip the radio, so the water runs off while using it, there is no problem.  I've now used the radio for quite a long time and do love it.",2015-08-29

The worst thing is that I did not realize only play 5 and sound bar can play external audio source. I thought SONOS is a solution for WIFI music streaming.

I purchased it at Walmart for the same price. After hearing the UE boom which is a great speaker in its own right and the soundlink another great speaker I found that I just couldnt afford the price tag. I ran into this little puppy by a company called gproject whome I had never heard of. Out of the box I was blown away. It was suuuuuuper easy to connect the bluetooth. Just hold the bluetooth button on the speaker and find the speaker on your device and BAM its connected. Now after having 2 high end sound systems I was expecting a let down in the sound quality arena especially when it comes to bluetooth sets. I was blown away by how well rounded and high end the sound quality is coming out of the device. Highs mids and bass are all on point even at high volumes. Its also built like its meant for military use. The construction is very durable and take it camping on a regular basis. Thr battery life is decent but I overlook this because I often push its limits on volume. If g project comes out with an update on the gboom I will be first in line to buy it. My friends compliment me on its quality all the time. Best bluetooth speaker for 100 bucks hands down.,2015-08-29

As a matter of fact, they were the originators of that trend, quickly followed by most other accessory manufacturers.  The cover sleeve has a nice clean image of the speaker, and after you slide it out and open the box, you will find A7909 model with included accessories.<br /><br />Accessories include a sturdy USB to micro-usb charging cable, 3.5mm to 3.5mm connector (for direct wired connection of the speaker), and a soft storage bag/pouch.  Charging and audio cable is typically something you will find with many other wireless speakers, but not too many others offer a storage bag.  Obviously, a pouch not going to protect your speaker from a high drop, but it could cushion it and provide some level of protection.  Plus, if you leave fingerprints on the plastic surface of the speaker  – a soft material of the pouch could be used to wipe them down.<br /><br />Out of the box, you will find a relatively compact brick shaped speaker with a dimensions of about 6.4” x 2.6” x 2.6” and weighting aproximately280g.  The speaker has a sturdy plastic enclosure with a metal grill on the front covering the drivers and on one side covering the bass port.  On the top you have 2 recessed large volume -/+ buttons to decrease/increase the volume level, and the area for NFC pairing.  Opposite of the bass port on the other side you will find a multi-function Power/Pair-up/Play-Pause button which also has a blue led backlight to indicate when power is on.  The back has charging led indicator, micro-usb charging port, and AUX 3.5mm audio input port.  It’s a very simple design with a clear layout of large easy to use controls.  The bottom has a non-slip rubbery pad for secure placement on any surface.<br /><br />Considering its slightly higher than expected pricing, yeah – Anker spoiled us with premium products at discounted prices, I was curious to explorer its spec and performanceto figure out the value of this BT wireless speaker.  First of all, it comes with a large 6200 mAh battery (that explains the weight) which can support almost 24 hours of playback at 60% volume setting or 18hr playback at a more realistic 70% volume setting.  It sure is impressive for a small compact speaker that isn’t longer than my Note 4.<br /><br />Inside, it has a dual 5W drivers and a dedicated bass port.  Obviously, it could function both wired and wireless.  Wireless pair up with a phone was seamless and I tested it to work 60’ away (!!!) from my phone in open space.  That’s very impressive for a supported wireless distance.  One important thing to keep in mind – it ONLY pairs up with a phone Media, not with a phone to work as a speakerphone.  In my own personal experience with at a least a dozen of BT wireless speakers I have tested, I never ever used any of them as a speakerphone.  Thus, I found a lack of speakerphone support is not a big deal.  The only comment I have here, during pair up speaker produces a loud and a bit annoying beep, which I wish would have been a little quieter.<br /><br />Thanks to its 5W speakers, Anker A7909 BT wireless speaker can get very loud and at the max speaker and phone volume level – I sensed NO distortion what so ever.  Obviously you have to be realistic that small drivers can produce a loud sound but it’s not a powerful room filling type of sound.  The sound is very clean and accurate, not too boomy or too thin, but the further you step away the less bass you hear.  Basically, this is not a type of speaker to entertain a big outdoor party or to fill in a big hall with a loud sound, it's intended for a smaller room listening where louder sound will fill in the room and where you will be able to enjoy better low end (bass) response.<br /><br />Conclusion.<br /><br />Anker usually doesn't disappoint with their new releases, and this new BT wireless speaker is no exception.  It is not necessary the top performeror the best value in &#34;small portable&#34; speaker category, but it definitely offers some unique features to be very competitive.  Battery life which can go up to 24hr is a big bonus.  5W dual speaker is loud and clean, and most important you can raise the volume all the way to the max without clipping or distortion.  And unlike so many other portable speakers with only Volume control, I like the integrated Play/Pause which is SO important.  The whole purpose of wireless speaker is to be away from the phone, and some manufacturers forget about it, making you go back to the phone to pause the song.  I'm glad Anker implemented this feature.  Backed up by their 18-month warranty, this is definitely a good product.  Priced at $69.99, I think it's a bit steep and it would be more realistic to have it priced closer to $50, but if you are looking for all the features offered by this wireless speaker - it worth the price.",2015-08-29

Sound is very crisp and feels like you're in the studio and for what they are, I think they're great. We did a lot of research ahead of time as we were considering Solo 2, Executive, and Studio.<br /><br />Pros (vs Studio and Executive)<br />- Do not require batteries (both Studio and Executive do) or need to be charged. Works like normal headphones you just plug in.<br />- Audio quality is superior to Executive for a musician who needs to hear everything clearly and crisp (studio quality)<br />- Price is way lower than Studio<br /><br />Cons (vs Studio and Executive)<br />- Less cool features like skipping back and pausing<br />- On-Ear. This means that after time the pressure of the headphones on your ears may begin to get uncomfortable or sore. Fortunately for my husband's needs / touring etc, this isn't a problem because he will have frequent breaks. I wouldn't recommend if you're spending hours on end in the studio, in that case I'd spring the extra cash for over ear.",2015-08-29

If your headphones have &#34;active noise cancelling&#34; or are otherwise battery-powered this should not be used, and it is also dangerous/unnecessary for use with in-ear headphones.<br /><br />I have used it for several weeks with my new Sennheiser HD DJ 8 headphones which are absolutely perfect, so that biases my experience. This is an extremely minimalistic amplifier, without any buttons or dials at all, which can be nice if you're going to have it in your pocket a lot anyways and would rather control your audio from 1 source (namely your smartphone or ipod.)<br /><br />Overall I have no complaints other than the incessant follow-up emails the parent company for this product sends you, hounding you for reviews and feedback.

This totally met my expectations in performance, and it exceeded my expectations in cost vs quality. In the two years I've had it, I've used it flying between the East Coast and Hawaii and around house. It wouldn't say it has 90% noise cancellation, but close; and when I'm listening to music or watching a movie, I'm only aware of the engine noise when there's a stretch of quiet in the audio. The size is convenient, and I like that I can still use it with the noise-canceling off or when the battery is dead. The only thing I don't like is the placement of the battery pack. It's awkward even when clipped on and would probably be better closer to the end even though there would still be some awkwardness. One thing I noticed with this is that the ear buds must fit tight and securely as it seems to rely on both notice canceling as well as noise isolation. Overall, it's a win, and I even bought another one as a gift.",2015-08-29

NiZn have a much higher voltage than NiMh -- up to 1.8 volts (vs 1.5v for alkaline and 1.2v for NiMh).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the technology still has some problems, and isn't yet mature.  Batteries may lose capacity quickly, and tend to self-discharge at higher and higher rates with each charge-cycle.<br /><br />I bought these, because they are rated at 1150mWh, which is higher than the more typical 1000mWh rating.  So I hoped these would be worth their higher-than-normal price.  However, these batteries are even worse than the typical NiZn batteries on the market today.  Of the four batteries, one was completely dead-on-arrival; and two others won't hold a full charge, after just one use.<br /><br />Only ONE of the four batteries managed to limp though two charge cycles, with enough capacity to even consider continuing to use it!  That's $5 per battery-use, which makes alkaline batteries seem like a good investment!<br /><br />Obviously, I won't be buying these batteries again.  I'm sticking with the lower-capacity 1,000 mWh versions.",2015-08-29

With Rap, and heavy metal being the worst.<br /><br />Typically i Would recommend Taotronics, products to anyone. I have tested many many bluetooth speakers, from both them and other companies, and typically Tao tronics delivers, better than what you would expect from a package.<br /><br />I have of course taken into account, its, specs, 3 watts, and as i stated previously, having sampled literally at least 20-25 different bluetooth speakers of all shapes and sizes, i had a very reasonable expectations for this speaker, and fir the first time Taotronics didn't deliver.<br /><br />Skimming the other reviews, i saw a lot of great reviews of the speaker, i typically, in general on amazon, figure that around half of all the sample for review 5 star reviews are done by people who just want free stuff, and then the other half are by people like me that give honest reviews, of how the products rate, and the reviews are what they are.<br /><br />Now that being said, Even ignoring half of the positive reviews, that still gives this speaker a great rating, so  it is very possible that i got a defective unit or it got broken in transport. I have an email out to Taotronics, to see if they want to send another, and if that happens, and the experience is different, i will surely update this review.<br /><br />As it stand however i would not recommend this unit to anyone. there is better to be had for the price from Taotronics.<br /><br />Sample provided for honest review.

The first thing I want to address is the charging problem some have and it has to do with one thing, it uses USB which requires it to be charged from a computer(trickle charge) and some outlet chargers. Some have mentioned that with this version and others they are only able to get about a half an hour to an hour worth of play time. If you charge it from a computer you will get 6 to 7 hours or more depending on what you are using it for.  Very sleek looking matte black color. Has 32 GB of memory built in which will be enough for most. If you would need more memory there is a slightly more expensive version that has a Micro SD memory card slot.  Let's start with the packaging and honestly this might be my biggest negative but really didn't effect my rating. It comes in a two part clear plastic case wrapped in glued on cellophane. Don't try to remove the cellophane, take a knife and slice along the sides where the two pieces of plastic come together, slice along the two long sides and the bottom short side, you will feel your knife slightly enter the slot along the sides. By leaving the top side connected you will have a flip open case.  The player itself fits my needs perfectly, mostly for walking and listening to music and audio books. I got over 4 hours of playing time using it for that and probably had more but decided to charge the player, I don't like to let the battery get to low. The player does so much more than play audio files, there are even 4 games included but watching video and playing games might not be the best things to use the player for because of the small screen size but you can, pictures and video quality were very good. You can also record what you are listening to on the radio to or use it as a voice recorder. The radio worked great and the reception was surprisingly good. My only real negative was the bass with the supplied ear buds was not very good even at the rocksetting on the equalizer but I rarely get good bass out of ear buds, the bass was a lot better with an over the ear pair of headphones.  The player was very intuitive, I never did look at the instructions and only encountered a few minor bumps in the road that I eventually figured out. The interface has a quaint old school pixelated look but really was a non issue for me. For my needs it was perfect and is very highly recommended for those with similar needs to mine.",2015-08-29

I will break down the review into different sections and give you my thoughts.<br /><br />The box and packaging<br />SHARKK have really outdone the presentation from their box, it's the kind of packaging I'd expect to see on products twice, if not three times the price. The closest I could compare too would be the extremely overpriced headphones from a company I won't mention. It features all the main specifications you need to know, such as a 4400mAh battery with 18 hours of battery life! The top of the box has a lid that slides off, to reveal the two speakers. These are extremely well protected, sandwiched in foam a good 3/4 of an inch thick. You then get all the accessories in a box the side of these.<br /><br />What's included<br />In the box you'll find the Two Speakers, marked A and B. A USB wall charger with two outputs, making it easy to charge without an additional plug. Two USB to Micro USB cables, two 3.5MM audio cables, an instruction manual, and finally two soft carry pouches, these I really did like as the Speaker's have such a nice finish that I'd hate to see damaged.<br /><br />The Speakers<br />The first thing I noticed about these speakers was the lovely soft touch Matt Black finish (my personal favourite finish) with a nice solid feel and weight. Each speaker has a printed A and B, to make pairing easier and they can be used a individual speakers if you wish) The SHARKK logo is displayed on the front of the pair, and both have two rows of function buttons, which also feature a cool white backlight which activate when detected by heat of all things! This I thought was just awesome.<br />Both speakers have options for the Mode which allows the user to switch between Bluetooth or AUX playback, synchronising the speakers (when playing AUX) and pairing the speakers together. There are also options for answering calls, previous and nexttrack, play/pause and volume up and down. The right side of each speaker has a power button (with LED), headphone jack, AUX port, and a micro USB port for charging.<br /><br />Paring<br />I first tried my luck pairing these speakers without the instruction manual, but without success. Once referring to the manual, I managed to pair them both in less than a minute. When you start the pairing process the speakers LED will start flashing blue and red rapidly, once the connection has been successful with your device the flashing will slow to a blue flash every few seconds. When using the AUX mode, the LED will change to green, and then red to charging. The Boombox also has the option to pair using NFC for you Android users, this is located towards the top right of your function buttons.<br /><br />Sound<br />I've used a lot of different speakers, but having two with a left and a right channel makes the experience so much better. The frequency response of 60Hz to 20KHz gives really deep bass (which being a bass head I love), the mids are well balanced and the highs lovely and clear. I found positioning the speakers roughly 4-5ft apart then angled towards me the best for playback, basically how you would position studio monitors. When you turn them up there is no distortion (which I have found from other similarly priced units) and they have more then enough oomph to fill room. Overall a great listing experience.<br /><br />My thoughts<br />Overall SHARKK have done a superb job with these speakers, and for the price I don't think there is a better option currently available. I've used a wide variety of speakers over the last few years, and these are without doubt the top of the list. The 4400mAh battery gives a massive 18 hour battery, but using just a few hours a day means you won't be charging them very much, which is a great bonus. Other small touches such as both units powering off with only pressing one speaker is a nice addition, as well as more basic touches suchas the carry pouches. If you are in two minds about this pair, take the plunge, you won't regret it.",2015-08-29

So what I liked about these headphones was the non-tangling cord, it’s flat which makes it harder to tangle back around itself. I also thought the angled jack was interesting as most just stick straight out of devices giving no thought or care as to how it might impact putting it into a pocket, how it sits, etc. This will work for devices without cases and some case and covers but it won’t work with any that have any thickness to them around the port area. It just can not plug in close enough. Overall they sounded all right, but nothing special. I didn’t think the bass was enough to warrant putting it in the name. They just seem average to me, but are a good price and the non-tangling is a plus making them a good option for kids who wind up going through a TON of earbuds and headphones in their time!",2015-08-29

Problem with automatic sound optimizing for powered subwoofer installations suspected,"The receiver shuts down and has to be re-booted even under moderate volume when running five NHT VS1.4 8 ohm impedance speakers and an M&K MX-350THX powered subwoofer.  The NHT speakers ran fine when powered by three Rotel RB981 130 Watt/channel stereo amps controlled by an Acurus ACT3 5.1 surround sound preamp.  The subwoofer also ran fine when connected to the Acurus ACT3.  The Yamaha receiver was purchased to replace and update that system.<br /><br />After talking with Yamaha, they suggested that the new receiver was defective -- since testing with the receiver's automatic speaker optimization did not indicate any shorts or polarity problems in the speaker installation, and that I try a replacement.<br /><br />Unfortunately the replacement shuts down and has to be re-booted even under moderate volume, even after implementing the receiver’s automatic speaker optimization and associated testing that came with the receiver - no polarity problem with the speakers, but all speakers except the subwoofer showing volume deviations of &#62;+10dB and the subwoofer deviating at -10db (a W-3 problem).<br /><br />I suspect that the problem may be because its software for automatically optimizing the speaker settings does not work for systems that have a self-powered subwoofer attached to the pre-amp lead for powered subwoofers and all other speakers attached to the receiver's speaker leads- as the instructions for the receiver specify<br /><br />It took an hour on hold to get through to Yamaha tech support again about this; and the person I reached, after an hour testing different settings, could not solve the problem of the system shutting down under moderate volume under most settings.  He elevated it to his supervisor with my request for level 2 tech support and said that Yamaha would get back to me in two days. Two days are up and I have not heard back from Yamaha.<br /><br />Later, after installing the wireless connection on the new receiver, the receiver then gave me a message that new firmware software was available. I downloaded installed the new Yamaha firmware and still had the same problem with it shutting down at moderate volumes.<br /><br />I did a long series of automated sound setup optimization runs and found speaker polarity issues reported -- along with the previously mentioned volume issues. What was really disturbing is that the speakers with polarity problems were reported to change almost every time I reversed the polarity on the speaker or speakers for which the speaker setup software detected an apparent polarity problem. After such adjustments, I usually got a different combination of speakers with polarity problems, but sometimes it showed the same problem on the same speaker despite reversing the polarity on the leads to that same speaker with an alleged polarity problem.<br /><br />Speaker connections reported to have polarity problems on different runs of the same speaker optimization software included<br />o  Left front and right and left surround speakers<br />o  Left front and left surround speaker<br />o  Left surround speaker only<br />o  Right surround speaker only...<br />o  Right and left surround speakers only<br />o  etc<br />Every surround sound speaker (except the center speaker and rarely the front right speaker) sometimes showed  a polarity problem on one or more runs . Concerning volume, the automatic speaker optimization for volume continued to show all speakers other than the powered subwoofer showing deviations of &#62;+10dB and the powered subwoofer deviating at -10db, confirming that the software installed on the receiver can’t deal with a powered subwoofer; and the upgraded firmware now shows inconsistent and erratic results concerning speaker polarity as well as the previously reported volume issue.<br /><br />If I do not hear back from their level 2 technical support and get the problem solved (or solve the problem myself by manually adjusting the speaker settings) soon, I will return the system for a refund and consider alternative systems for properly driving my speakers.",2015-08-29

There are a few reasons I prefer this device to earbuds. First of all, how many times have you been working around the house and gotten the cord hung up and the buds get snatched out of your ears? Or worse, the phone gets snatched out of your hand and goes flying? Okay, maybe I'm just a moron.<br />Another advantage is that you can still hear sounds around you. I use this speaker when I'm working around the house while listening to books or podcasts. With earbuds, my family has to wave me down to get my attention. Not with this device. I can hear the doorbell or other stuff while listening.<br />As for how it stacks up to other portable devices - I would say it's solid. The price is reasonable, the size is small enough to fit in a book bag, but still gives a nice full sound. And it really is simple to set up and use.<br />If you are looking for premium sound this isn't it.

But having spent much of my life listening to, assembling, and living with high end stereo systems and environments, as well as spending 4 years in a conservatory listening to live music every day, and having previously had a positive view of Amar Bose's company, I was disappointed at the sound of this product.  Bose spent much of his life studying the physics of sound and how sounds could be realistically reproduced in different environments from where they were recorded.  His 901 speakers were a breakthrough, as was the Bose Wave radio, both of which I've listened to on several occasions.  The Wave was a small unit about the size of the Soundlink, yet it produced realistic stereo sound on a table top, over 30 years ago.  (It is still available  as the Wave III.)  Yet the Soundlink III paired with my LG G2 sounded surprisingly flat.  It was reasonably loud, and clear, but lifeless, just the opposite of the style the Bose company developed and made its name on.  I boxed it all up again, printed out a return label, and will take it to UPS next week.  But I made a discovery in the course of setting the Soundlink up that gave me the sound I was looking for without having to spend a penny.  As the Soundlink tried to pair with my phone, I noticed that my Roku player came up as a connectable device.  I'd read about this, but hadn't tried it.  After the Soundlink was reboxed, I downloaded the Roku app to my G2, paired the device with my phone, and suddenly I was hearing perfectly acceptable stereo from my 26&#34; Emerson TV/DVD player that I bought at Walmart a few years back for $120.00.  It's nobody's separate components, but it was much better than the Soundlink III.  So figuring it all up, even if you don't own a Roku player now, you could buy one for 60 bucks, grab an Emerson at Walmart for under 150, download the free Roku app, and save yourself a hundred bucks compared to the Soundlink -- and get, in my view, much better sound.  You should also realize that the current crop of Bluetooth and similar add-on speakers from any brand don't give you stereo sound in other rooms, just more largely monophonic sound.  Sometimes they add a little reverb for &#34;presence.&#34; For some this is adequate.  But if you're looking for true hi rez stereo in multiple rooms you need to look somewhere else.  It just isn't what the Soundlink or Sonos or many other similar systems are designed to do.  They're predicated on the idea that music off your phone is good enough.  On headphones/earbuds that's often true.   But from a single speaker in a big room...  I'd have second thoughts.  I have great respect for the Bose brand, and though their products have never been cheap, they've usually represented good value.  That wasn't my experience here.  Perhaps the Soundlink will work fine for you.  But I would proceed with caution.",2015-08-29

I removed the lamp and on inspection noted that the arc tube looked great, but the cement failed, allowing the art tube to move from centered in the reflector, to rest nearly touching the rim of the reflector.  The 2nd lamp failed within a month, but this time the arc tube failed by failing to start.  I am now on the third lamp since March 2015.

This holds true not just for DACs but preamps, power amps, headphones and speakers.  I was previously running my music straight from my PC to a DAC and into my system.  The music sounds cleaner coming from the iPod/ipure combo. it might be owed to the iPod having much less noise and working parts than the computer motherboard.

Yamah said they have not had this reported before.  I find that hard to believe.  I've had mine for a week and already I am having occasional picture loss...it just goes blank for 2 to 3 seconds and then comes back on.  On one occassion it went out for 2 or 3 minutes and I changed inputs from the remote to other devices and finally back to T.V. and it came on.  I am concerned that this problem may become more troublesome in the future.  Right it does it intermitantly about 3 or 4 times during a T.V. viewing session.  I thought the first time it happened it was the cable.  I'm still not sure but I will keep an eye on it to see if the problem persists.  The reason I am concerned is because of the length review made by another user for seemingly the same problem.  Otherwise I have to say the sound is awesome, the picture through the HDMI is super and I cant wait till I get a 4K.  Hopefully this receiver will live up to.  Apparently amazon doesnt want to publish my review, its been several days and they have not added my review yet.  Although, I will add an update.... I changed inputs and its been 4 days with no picture loss.  I originally had a PS3 on input 1 (Scene BD/dvd_ and TV on input 2 (TV scene).  As I was having no problem on input 1 with the PS3, I moved TV to input 1 and changed the PS3 to input 3.  I believe that hdmi input 2 was the problem.  This receiver has the potential of being an awesome receiver if it were not the intermittant picture loss that many others have experienced.  Since I dont need all the HDMI inputs, I will just consider input bad and stay away from it.  I am changing my rating to 4 star and I would definately recommend to a friend with the warning that they may experience the picture loss problem, but judging by the comments of many others that have had this  problem, it is curable via several different methods<br /><br />its overall reputation.  My 3 star rating is based onthe occassional picture loss, otherwise its a 5 star.  I will update this review in a few days<br /><br />Update to my review.  its still 3 stars but would be a solid 5 stars were it not for the intermittant picture loss.  I have confirmed it is not cable.  The picture loss occurs intermitantly and the longer I watch tv, the more frequent it becomes.  As I have seen other reviews dealing with this issue I cant understand why Yamaha hasnt come up with a solution.  The picture loss only comes through the HDMI input and output.  I know there are other connections but I dont want to go back to a multitude of cables and I dont want to lose the on screen menu.  Help Yamaha!!",2015-08-29

I found that you don't just aim it at the direction of the station.  You have to bank it like an airplane tipping it's wings.  I could see that the station locked in with a much stronger signal.

US,29293105,R3BWJ0GEK7NKJP,B00WU2KJSO,955611184,Philips A1Pro/27 Professional DJ Headphones  designed with Armin Van Buuren- Black,Electronics,4,16,18,Y,N,Offer excellent sound reproduction but seem slightly overpriced,"Although I am not a professional DJ, from time to time my husband and I do some studio work that requires a good pair of headphones. I personally found these to be too heavy for my liking (not to mention kind of large for my ears) so I asked my husband to evaluate them. He was happy to try these out and after having spent several weeks with them shared his overall impressions with me which I am passing along his thoughts.<br /><br />Size and build quality:<br /><br />These headphones are fairly ruggedly made. They are a little on the heavy side (just under a pound with the cable) but they offer a well padded headband and comfortable ear cushions. They fit snugly for good sound isolation. The cable is detachable and can be connected to either driver depending on which side you prefer. The cable connection is unique. The angled connector is keyed at the plug and needs to be inserted with the cable perpendicular to the driver body in order to lock it in.<br /><br />Two things worth noting: 1) the cable is a little over 50” long and with the coiled section and extends to about 8’ rather than the 15’ that they claim in the specs.  2) in the product description it says that these come with three different sized ear cushions. They do NOT. They come with one medium sized pair of ear cushions.<br /><br />I do feel, given the price, that Philips should have included all three sizes of cushions as advertised.  They can be purchased in a smaller or larger size, according to the manual and website, but run between $35-$46 a pair depending on the size. The ability to isolate sound depends on the fit of the ear cushions and is an important feature. If you purchase these and they don't fit properly it could be an issue. An issue that could have been avoided by having more than one size cushion to choose from. And for some people, this one small detail could be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />I have tested these headphones with all types of music. I listened critically to rock, jazz, r&b, classical, piano, guitar, bass and vocals. I set up my listening device at a flat level so the sound would not be colored by any equalization. In my opinion they have a well balanced sound that doesn’t accentuate any one range over the other. You can hear the timbre of the instruments with excellent sound reproduction. Sounds are crystal clear and free of distortion. These headphones are not bass heavy, and I am personally happy about that. Should you desire more bass you can crank it up using an equalizer.<br /><br />Other considerations:<br /><br />The price is a bit of a sticking point for me. I ask myself &#34;would I spend almost $400 retail on these headphones.&#34; As a home studio musician or more casual listener, I'm not certain that I could justify the price. Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is excellent but I have several older pairs of professional headphones that I actually prefer over these in terms of overall design and comfort.<br /><br />I really do enjoy the way that these reproduce sound but, when all is said and done, I have not been able to fall in love with the current price tag.d vocals.

My first pair was purchased at an Apple Store.the sound is quite good for someone who fancies himself as an audiophile. I have the much ballyhooed and celebrated &#34;Beats earphones&#34; which are a little cumbersome to place correctly on your ear and, most of all, just too bass heavy. I like my music eq'd with more treble where the piano tickles brightly, the high hat shimmers and the instrumentation is bright and sparkling. The downside of the Etymotic, which indeed offers a more treble eq, is having to constantly replace the filters (about every 6 months). That becomes a tad costly ($15 a set) and laborious. I would have thought that Etymotic would have found a much more user friendly solution by now.",2015-08-29

Changing my rating from 3 to one star because the power switch problem as outlined below has now changed to where I can no longer use the Bluetooth feature at all. I can now only use it on AUX with a cord, which totally defeats the reason that I purchased this overpriced unit in the first place. Very disappointed!   Worked great for about a year plus a few months. But now I am having a problem where every time that I try to use it through Bluetooth, it comes on and syncs, and then starts acting like the battery is low, even though it is fully charged. I found that if I flip the power switch off, then back on again, and resync, it will work until I have to turn it back off again. It does this every time now, and even proactively flipping the switch on/off before syncing, will not work. I have to do the tedious procedure above. I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if not for this flaw, and it would have been nice if the USB could have also been an input for music files on a flash drive.",2015-08-29

Now the whole thing..  I purchased this unit along with the L16 cable a couple days ago.. arrived last evening. Unboxed, checked it on the fiio site, it's legit. I charged it, read all the product info, registered it while charging and the I proceeded to play... First off, to those who say an easy to drive, or low impedance headphone doesn't require amp... I call BS. I use ATH-M50x cans. 38ohm.. I previously used the e6 little tiny square dude from fiio.. and even that little bugger helped when it came to dynamics. Point being, to hear the full potential of a set of HP you need power, and clean power... This Mont Blanc just THROWS effortless clean power at you and it is scary! I highly suggest a good interconnect cable, I tried a cable I had used in the past and the first time I heard the e12 I was blown away .Then I connected the right angle cable that came with the amp.... Big improvement. I then connected the L16, it absolutely transformed my setup into a mobile hi-fi/quasi audiophile system. Basically, for everyone that is thinking and thinking and thinking about this amp, think no more, just do it. With 880mW of power, it is approximately 20 times the power, and multitudes cleaner than a phone or DAP amp. So glad I made this purchase. My AT's have NEVER sounded this good.",2015-08-29

I just purchased this an hour ago because I didn't want to wait any longer. I hee-ed & haw-ed over the reviews here and elsewhere... I heard someone else's Bose mini and it sounded incredible...especially the bass. I wanted one but the price kept me at bay. This friend's 'mini' just kept wooing me... So I began to sike myself into justifying buying this at $299 because I like good speakers with good bass. It's NOT A BOOM BOX!!!! I listen to all types of music [Jazz, R&B, Classical, Soft Easy Listening, Reggae, etc.]. When I want to listen to extremely LOUD earth shattering music, I turn on my home system with my Cerwin Vega 15 in woofers...LOL Since I needed a portable with great sound and Bose is known for quality sound, I decided to purchase my first Bose speaker. EUREKA!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  I am SOOOOO glad that I was NOT swayed by the nay-sayers.... Right out the box, in my bedroom, I plugged it in, paired it with my iPhone, started Amazon Music via Amazon Prime and WOW!!!!!! I'm in a new zone. WOW!!!!. I am COMPLETELY satisfied. I AM A 'BOSE OWNER' now. Great sound. I mainly bought this for travel and connecting with my ipod classic via the aux connection. I will be testing that connection soon after I wallow in this awesome atmosphere of clean music from my amazon music via prime....

UPDATE: Sep. 2, 2015: It's been a few days now and I am still in a new Bose zone.

Four hours of continous play and no issues. ALSO, i have had no bluetooth issues, at all. No dropped bluetooth connections or issues connecting to laptop.

Most portable speakers don't have speakers large enough to make any decent sound at a loud level, so I thought this one might fit the bill.<br /><br />It sounds much better than most super tiny portable bluetooth speakers you'll find, and to be honest, for the price its about exactly what you should expect. However, it still falls pretty short for me in two regards - sound quality and battery life.<br /><br />The sound is decent, but it kind of sounds like they didn't put any sort of crossover on the woofer, so it gets really muddled/cutting highs on the woofer side of the speaker when it is kicking bass. The tweeters sound decent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it barely made 1hr of use on a full charge. I didn't pay attention to the specs when I bought it, but a 1000mAh battery is way too tiny for this. I would happily have paid $10 more to have like 10x the battery life.<br /><br />I have a Dayton DTA-1 Class T amplifier and threw 8 AA NiMH batteries in it and hooked it up to a Polk Audio Monitor 30 bookshelf speaker, and it sound SO SO MUCH BETTER than this thing.<br /><br />While this offers bluetooth and convenience, I'm not willing to give up loudness, sound quality, or battery life for it.

There is a Bass Boost button on it but it should NOT be switched on by default. It already reproduces bass extremely well w/o it, what you do need it for certain genres of music which sounds a whole lot better with it switched on, eg Hip-hop, Techno, House, R&B, Rap etc.<br /><br />How good is it? Well, you can feel the ear-pads vibrate gently on your ears ever so gently from the seismic activity going on inside! (that's a compliment, not a knock-down), and that's a side-effect from the chest-pounding, gut-thumping, pants-flapping bass that envelopes your eardrums! For other genres of music - pop/rock etc most likely you won't be needing the Bass Boost. If you're looking for a headphone with the best bass - specifically, for the type of music you listen to - this is it! But there is some preps to be done before you settle down to them - adjust your device's software EQ (I use PowerAmp and EQ for my Android-based Sony tablet) - to tweak it to match the headphone's strengths and weaknesses, perhaps more than one sound profile also, based on different genres of music you listen to. They are &#34;fun&#34; headphones, not accurate, not flat nor audiophile, but hi-fi it definitely is!<br /><br />Is there anything that's not good? Well, the mids and highs do not fare as well as its low frequencies, not bad or awful, just.. decent. It's not a deal breaker but just don't expect it to sound good when you're playing audiophile recordings. Clarity is not as good as &#34;accurate&#34; monitor headphones, spaciousness is not as wide as you'd want, and don't expect it to reveal the soundstage of the recording either. I tried it with audiophile vocals, instrumentals and classical, and even with the Bass Boost off, the bass will still clamor for attention and the clarity/transparency/spaciousness will be not be exemplary. I know and am speaking from experience because I do listen to audiophile recordings on my home audio setup, and I know what's missing when I listen to these same recordings on the headphones. But for what I bought the headphones for - hiphop/techno/rock/pop etc - they do their job with gusto.  They are fun/chill-out headphones, not for critical listening. If you absolutely demand above average clarity/soundstage from your headphones, take off one star to make it 4 stars. If you want jaw-dropping, eye-opening bass energy for your kind of music, 5 stars are certainly in order here and you won't regret the purchase.",2015-08-29

I wish all companies would take up this practice of shipping their products fully charged.  The Bluetooth paring to my iPhone was relatively simple.  I like that the speaker talks to you to tell you that its powered on as well as paired.  The sound that comes from this little speaker was very impressive.  I don't like how the lights come on automatically with powering up.  It would be nice if it defaulted to no lights, but three touches of the dimmer button shuts them off, so it's not a big deal.  I like the size of the buttons on the speaker.  There's three buttons on the side.  One controls the dimming and the other two change the lights and the light patterns (mood inducing).  On the top of the speaker there are six buttons.  A power, two volume controls, a skip forward and back, and a pause/play button.  Next to the power button is a rubber flap that underneath houses the charging port, a aux in port and a spot to insert a key (included in packaging) to change language.

So when I came across these I figured I'd give them a try since they have the hooks that over the top and behind your ear. When I first put them on after I received them they felt comfortable in my ear. I did my &#34;jumping jack test&#34; to see if they stayed in/on my ears and they did!<br /><br />I used them for the first time at the gym this morning where I ran about two miles and did ten minutes on a stair master machine. As you can imagine I was pretty sweaty at the end of my workout! Throughout the entire workout they did not once fall or slip out of my ears oncr. I didn't have to blare my music to cancel out all the external noise either.<br /><br />Overall,  I'd say for the price (considering some wireless headphones/ear buds are going for $100+) this is a great deal.<br /><br />Since I've only uses them once, I will update if I have any issues in the future.",2015-08-29

I had started with a smaller Class A amplifier, moved on to a better Class A 300B tube amp and still wanted to explore further. Mainly because I was hooked on the warm sound of the tube amps but I was feeling the need for a bigger sound if that makes sense. I am driving a pair of Energy RC 70 floorstanding speakers and I felt they could use a higher output amp. The Yaqin had very good reviews online and I had a feeling it would deliver. It does! It is my preferred amp at the moment. Mainly because it just has a lot of power along with the clarity of tube amps. Being a push-pull amp, it has a much higher output compared to my other amps. I was a bit intimidated by the bias setting manipulation at first, but after having done it few times it is now second nature. You will need a multimeter and and play around with it depending on your tubes and how it sounds to you. The recommended setting is 350mv. I found that I prefer it just under around 300mv where it seems to hit the sweet spot for my amp. Basically, if you are a noob like me, all you need to do is get the multimeter and make sure all four tubes are set at same level and that you like the sound you hear. I did change the preamp tubes to Tung-sols and it made a slight improvement over the stock tubes. The amp itself is very very heavy and solid. It has an attractive finish and feels very well made. As with any tube amp, it seems to have a break in period and definitely gets better with use. But even right out of the box the sound is impressive. I decided to go with this version over the other Yaqin which has plastic covers as I felt that those covers just get in the way. I like to roll tubes which is part of the charm of tube amps. Will this be my last stop in the journey - time will tell - but for now, I am quite content enjoying my albums on this amp. It rocks!",2015-08-29

Most people don't have 5.8GHz devices--even if you have a 5.8GHz router, many of them are dual-band and will run at 2.6GHz as well.  The one exception I discovered is the Xbox One's wireless controller.  This means that any time I'm playing a game that requires the controller, I have to turn off the transmitter, which is very frustrating.  5.8GHz devices are supposed to be &#34;spread-spectrum,&#34; meaning there are actually several frequencies or channels near 5.8GHz that devices can automatically switch between to find the best one, and to have good enough tuning to not bleed into the adjacent channels.  With the Amphony transmitter on, I can watch my Xbox One controller try one channel after the next, and occasionally will make a connection if it is within 6 feet of the Xbox One, but it loses that connection within 5 minutes.  This device seems to be poorly tuned, because the other channels are wiped out. Either that or it (inappropriately) uses all the channels at the same time.<br /><br />When I can use the transmitter, it seems to work okay.  It is VERY placement and direction sensitive, and minor changes seem to dramatically affect reception, even with the receiver 10 minutes away.  Noise is heard as annoying &#34;pops&#34; rather than static, and can be produced if you walk anywhere near the line-of-sight between the antennas.  Sound quality is quite good.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it 4 stars if it weren't for the Xbox One issue, but I have one and use it often, so it still matters.  If you have other 5.8 GHz devices in your house, be aware of this.",2015-08-29

This is after basically calling Sol every other day, asking about the status of my refund. And I had to call from a different phone number, because for *some* reason, I could never get through to a customer service agent when using my phone, sometimes even getting sent straight to voicemail.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you buy this, DO NOT BUY DIRECTLY FROM SOL REPUBLIC<br /><br />10/15 UPDATE:<br />Sol Republic’s customer service is the worst. My return was received by Sol on October 8th, and a week later I still haven’t received my refund (or any kind of notification that it is coming soon).<br /><br />I then call Sol’s customer support, who say they will call back me back soon with more details. Flash-forward 2 hours, still no call. So I sit on hold for 10 minutes and get kicked off, then again for 5 minutes. Still nothing.<br /><br />So I dial *67 then Sol’s customer support #, and then miraculously they answer my call! What good fortune!<br /><br />So to recap Sol’s poor customer service: it took them over 24 hours to email me back, then they didn’t refund me, and then they were obviously screening and not answering my calls. Just amazingly poor customer support.<br />-------------------<br /><br />9/30 UPDATE:<br /><br />So I gave these another shot – More or less the same experience, but this time I used them at my office job. It just wasn’t very practical to have one earbud in, and the other just hanging down the front of my dress shirt. And they didn’t stay on great – they would nearly slide off at times, since they didn’t have a good grip due to the fact that the headphones weren’t resting on my neck skin, but on my dress shirt.<br /><br />Also, I didn’t have a great experience with Sol Republic’s customer support (this time I bought from their website due to coupon code). I emailed customer support, inquiring about their return process and I still haven’t received a response as of 24 hours later. I then called customer support, and they said they would email me a RMA form so I could ship my return, but as of 1 hour later I haven’t received any email from Sol Republic customer support. I guess I need to call them again...<br /><br />I think these headphones are great for when you are able to have both earbuds in while wearing a tshirt/polo shirt/unbuttoned dress shirt, but they just aren’t practical for a corporate office setting.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Really enjoyed this Bluetooth earbuds. Definitely more comfortable and blends in better than LG's Tone Infinim, but really wish they included retractable earbuds (like LG's).<br /><br />Tried to use these while biking, and experienced a lot of &#34;skipping&#34; audio, despite my iPhone less than a foot away strapped on my arm. Had trouble with earbuds staying in too while biking.<br /><br />Summary: Great bluetooth earbuds, but wouldn't recommend for gym/exercise use.earbud in, and the other just hanging down the front of my dress shirt.

Definitely recommend.","I purchased this product after reading other reviews, and I was not disappointed. The build quality is very solid, almost bordering on too solid. I had to loosen most of the joints to get them adjusted. Other reviews have stated that the outer monitors sag; I have found the sagging to be minimal. They include an adjustment to the center monitor to adjust for this. Initially, I installed my existing 23&#34; acer monitor in the middle, with two new lenovo ips panels on the sides. The whole project took me about an hour. I found the instructions very easy to follow and understand.<br /><br />My old monitor had a thicker surrounding bezel than the new ips monitors. Because of this, I could only angle the outside monitors slightly before the arms were at their maximum. The new monitors were so much more beautiful than my old one, I decided to get a third lenovo and replace the center monitor. Once again, I found the process relatively painless. Now I have much more room to adjust, as the lenovo bezels are at least an inch thinner than the acer was. In my current setup, I always keep the center monitor in landscape, and rotate between landscape and portrait with the outside two as it suits my mood.<br /><br />My advise is to consider the bezel in addition to the screen size, as these vary quite a bit. I could see three 24&#34; monitors working just as well, but they would have to be frameless. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend going above 23&#34;. Also, try to use lighter monitors on the sides to avoid sagging. Also, there are cable guides along the arms, and you can route the cables through the back pole. However, if your power cables are exceptionally thick, you will not be able to route all three monitors' cables through the back poles. I had extra, flatter power cables I swapped for the ones that came with the monitor, and now everything is gorgeous! I did not use the included through mount; I just used the C-shaped stand. It is extremely stable and looks great.",2015-08-29

It made a little bit of difference if the channel wasn't coming in clear.  I had issues with my first unit so I reached out to customer support and they were very prompt in their reply.  They immediately sent out a replacement.

I was as excited as a child on Christmas Day when it arrived. It was a breeze setting it up, programming it, since I already had set-up my Harmony 670. This thing worked like a dream. That feeling didn't last long. About 9 months to a year later, the screen &#34;Froze&#34;. It would do nothing. None of the functions worked. There were no instructions telling me what to do to fix it. I eventually decided I needed to leave the remote OFF the charging dock. The screen eventually went blank, it took about a week & the remote needed recharging. The next day, the remote was put back into operation. It worked like a dream.....until it happened again & again & again & again. The last time it &#34;Froze&#34; was just over a week ago. It had just finished recharging yesterday & the remote was put back into use. When I got home from work today, I was informed that the screen had &#34;FROZEN&#34; AGAIN. It did not work properly for 24 hours when it &#34;Froze&#34; again. Fortunately, through all of this, I was able to put the Harmony 670 back into service, with new batteries. It works like dream. Does anyone know what is happening when the screen &#34;Freezes&#34; or &#34;Locks-Up&#34; like this? This remote cost too much for this to be happening. This is ridiculous!

Happy with that. But it's a lot larger than I expected. Measures 6&#34; base (round) and total height is 3 1/2 inches. The cube is 3 3/4 inches square and 3&#34; high (from the top of the base), including the base and prongs for additional cubes on top. The box it came (see picture) in is not at all what I received but I did get what I ordered. The instructions were definitely written by someone with SOME English grammar but you know it was written by someone who is not in command of the English language. Again, very disconcerting. It was made in China, of course. Nothing says Yubi on it. The brand on this one is Safemore. I really would like to get exactly what I ordered, with instructions written with good English grammar and in a box that represents the product. I have been charging my completely spent iPad. It's been 2 1/2 hours and it's only at 20% (apparently iPads take a bit longer). My iPhone charged rather quickly, however. Haven't tried my husband's Kindle but he's charging his SkyCaddie right now and it seems to have charged fairly quickly. Overall, I guess it's going to suffice.

Some of them are cheap and some more expensive, but they all seemed to sound about the same! I saw this speaker at Best Buy for $60, and price checked with amazon for about $30. For 30 dollars I wasn't expecting much, I was expecting the run of the mill speaker that sounds like every other Bluetooth speaker out there. But when I played it for the first time I was truly amazed at how much sound that speaker put out, and the quality of the sound! I truly love this speaker, and will continue to buy HMDX products from now on.<br /><br />PROS:<br /> - This speaker is LOUD! It will fill an entire room with sound at half volume, and at full volume you'll have to turn it down!<br /> - This speaker can be paired with another Jam Plus. Please see the end of this review for instructions on how to pair the speakers.<br /> - The Jam Plus is water resistant, I have used it near my pool multiple times and I'm sure it's been splashed. The speaker still works fantastically!<br /> - It has built in buttons to control your music. The buttons include &#34;Play/Pause&#34;, &#34;Volume Up&#34; and &#34;Volume Down&#34;.<br /> - This speaker is very durable. I've dropped it and the worst that has happened is a small chip in the side of the speaker. The speaker still works well though!<br /> - Will work with any Bluetooth compatible device.<br /> - This speaker actually has a built in microphone that's used to take calls if you're speaker is paired to your phone.<br /><br />CONS:<br /> - The loud voice prompts can get annoying, and there doesn't seem like there is a way to disable them!<br /> - By itself the speaker only plays in Mono, but it doesn't seem to degrade the quality much.<br /> - The battery in this speaker doesn't last very long, and has to be recharged often.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Overall I'd recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a affordable, good sounding, and loud speaker. I still can't believe this speaker is only $30 because it sounds better than my other $50 speaker!<br /><br />PAIRING INSTRUCTIONS:<br />First look on the bottom of each speaker and move the switch on one speaker to &#34;L&#34; and one to &#34;R&#34;. Next, press and hold the power button under the first speaker, then press and hold on the power button on the second speaker.

I have actually gone to the trouble to make the alarms radio stations that turn on in the middle of the day while I'm at work. Hopefully the cats enjoy the music when it turns on.

It's much easier for the older ones to see it bigger so he said this will allow him to show pictures and video on our tv instead of his laptop.

The 4 usb ports on the end have charged anything I've put on them (kindle, iPhone, iPad, Galaxy note).  Even the devices that can be picky about their charger (kindle & iPhone) have not had a problem.  We typically have between 3 and 6 devices plugged in (4 usb ports & 2 adapts plugged into the outlets) with out problem.<br /><br />Two notes:<br /> - the switch on the end controls the usb ports. It toggles quite easily if your moving it about and getting it plugged in.  So a couple times when we were in a hurry and not paying attention, it has been toggled off and our devices didn't charge.<br /> - the notation of which usb is 2A or 1A is very small, indented print.  We find it hard to read in any kind of light.  If getting the right amperage for your device is important, I would recommend a dot of nail polish by them to make it easier to identify.<br /><br />I've now bought a second one for my parents' charging dock.  Sure beats a traditional power strip with a bunch of adapters.",2015-08-29

It will not charge standard non-Garmin NiMh batteries. There is good reason for this other than simple profiteering by Garmin. The design is very well thought out in that it should be impossible to accidentally charge the wrong battery type, potentially a very dangerous thing to do. Without the mechnical interupt provided by the Garmin battery pack detection switch it would be possible to pass charging current through, say lithium AA batteries. Doing this could be disasterous, possibly even resulting in fire or explosion. Bypassing the switch (with a bit of plastic) will enable charging of non Garmin batteries in the GPS unit. However doing this with batteries other than NiMh or NiCd types is ill advised for the reasons stated above. I do not work for Garmin, so have no vested interest, but wanted to make others aware of the risks associated with bypassing the battery type detector switch. I use externally charged Eneloop NiMh AA batteries in mine, they work just fine and power the GPS for much longer than the included Garmin battery pack.",2015-08-29

Just installed this cable and it was a good snug fit and it articulates in every direction so there was no more stress on the HDMI port. I am really happy about this as the video card has one HDMI port and cost over $300 and I was worried it was going to break.  Great cable didn't cost much and seems to send a great signal.

Sony's extra Bass series is often overlooked.  There over ear and on ear extra Bass headphones deliver gobs of boomy bass but are muddy sounding.  These do not follow that sound style.  They are bright with tight punchy Bass alongside strong treble and mids.  They don't sacrifice any frequency but they also aren't the loudest pure Bass earphones in town.  Pioneer's new cx8 earphone is much bassier (so much so they vibrate at loud volumes) but at the sacrifice of highs and miss.  All genres from rap to metal to country sound good through the Sony xb90 with just the right amount of Bass to please.<br /><br />I only have one other Xb model earphone to compare these to and that is the xb50 and these from a fuller clearer sound point of view blow the xb50's away.

When I got them (I ordered one for each speaker) they worked well, everything played fine and the speakers' lights stayed on.<br /><br />I typically dont use computer audio except for YouTube or iTunes, and I turn off these speakers so I dont wear them or the wires out. Yesterday I turned them on to play some music, and the satellite speakers (which use the extension wires) sounded like they were in a mile long can and the led lights were nothing but flickers of light.<br /><br />I not very knowledgeable about sound systems and wires, so I assumed my speakers were broken and spent an hour trying to figure out what was wrong. When I was ready to return my speakers I remember I had these extension wires.<br /><br />I removed the wires, plugged the original speakers into the subwoofer and immediately my speakers were fine. I tested the extension wires on my phone and headphones, they both worked fine. I even connected them with another 4 inch extension wire with a L-shaped jack, and they were still good- unfortunately my jack stopped working when o try to use it  but I think it's just old and needs to be replaced. What was REALLY interesting to me was that when the broken jack was reconnected with this extension wire, it worked again, though maybe the signal just went straight through the broken jack. I repeat, I'm not very knowledgeable about sound.<br /><br />To recap: Even though these are thin wires.and feel like they won't last long, they're good wires, but make sure they are only connected to speakers that only need to transmit sound, because they don't seem to work for trasmitting additional (power for?) effects.",2015-08-29

The power does not go completely out when you turn the system off, therefore there is a major blue light flashing &#34;standby&#34; at all times.  Although there is a on/off switch in the back that you can turn total power off....if you can reach it depending on where you place the system.  The connection sent did not work for connecting my tv.  I had to search for a different connection and had to plug into head phone connection to get the sound to work with the tv.  I finally figured out that I had to turn off the surround sound on the menu of my tv to only hear sound from the sound base and not the tv too.  Seems like I have mostly &#34;cons&#34;, but I decided to keep it since it was going to cost $13.25 to return it, plus a trip to the UPS store.  All in all it does sound better than the sound that was coming out of the tv before I purchased this.  You will have to decide for yourself, I cannot recommend it, there has to have been something better out there for the price, I just went with the ratings that others had given. Good luck.",2015-08-29

It’s my favorite among my others (Maha MH-C9000, LaCrosse BC-9009, Thunder AC-6, and a number of simpler chargers).<br /><br />I just purchased a BT-C3100 V2.2 to add to my collection. Key changes:<br />1. By holding down the “Display” button for 3 seconds (it actually takes 4), the LED backlight can be configured to stay on continuously. For me, this is a great feature in the dimly lit location where the charger is located.<br />2. During a REFRESH mode, the mAh of the current or most recent of the three DISCHARGE cycles is shown on the display. This corrects showing a much less useful reading of the charging mAh.<br />3. The fan is supposed to be quieter, but I haven’t observed any difference. Maybe younger ears could hear a difference.<br /><br />I’ve made two modifications to my older BT-C3400 V2.1:<br />1. Added two posts at the rear that are wired to the “tip” ends of two adjacent battery slots. This allows me to use alligator clips to connect batteries that don’t fit in the charger. I use these mainly for rectangular camera batteries (see photo of clip adapters).<br />2. Added a wire to force the backlight LEDs to be ON all the time (see photos of circuit board). This adds another 50 mA from the 12V supply. The wire basically bypasses LED switching transistor 1AM in the photos. Simply remove the four screws in the base to open the unit for access. A fine tip soldering iron and good soldering skills are required.<br /><br />Obviously, these mods void the warranty and risk damaging the unit.",2015-08-29

I seem to purchase new bluetooth speakers every several weeks  because I am not totally impressed with the ones I purchased.  Including the Sharkk 2o, I own 6 bluetooth speakers.  My favorite bluetooth speakers are the HDMX Jam Party and Ecogear Ecorox.  Both are rugged (not waterproof) with great bass.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Along comes the Sharkk 2o.  I purchased mine based on JJCEO's excellent review.  This speaker has the same weight as the HDMX Jam Party and has a slightly better bass than both the Jam Party and Ecorox.Others have posted what comes in the package so I won't.<br /><br />I have listened to the Beats Pill in stores and in my opinion, the Sharkk 2o sounds better in bass and clarity.  I cranked up the volume to maximum and no vibrations or distortions. I inserted a microSD card, switched to that mode and my music started without a hitch.  I was able to changed songs using the buttons on top of the speakers.  The is a plus in case you do not have a music device with you but still want to listen to tunes.<br /><br />This speaker is sharp looking with both silver trim and gray rubberized cover.

One night with her, and you'll be begging for more.<br /><br />She's got some magic going on inside her tiny little body, because she sings like an angel. She can go high, she can go low, and she'll get you moving with a surprisingly strong bass. She'll fill a room with sound from anywhere inside! Put her on a nightstand, a window sill, or a bookshelf, and let her 30-foot Bluetooth range take care of the rest.<br /><br />Her skin is smooth and she has all the right curves. She easy to handle, she fits right into your hands, and her smooth, round metallic exterior feels nice to the touch. The construction feels solid and high-quality, you won't have to worry about breaking this baby if you're a little rough. She also comes in a sturdy jar packaging that can double as a protective case when she's packed up.

So far my impressions are that the sound is &#34;okay,&#34; or maybe just a bit above average. For $100 it's probably middle of the road sound quality in comparison to similarly priced headphones. The mids in these are pretty pronounced, but in a lot of music (I tend to lean into the rock, hip-hop genres) the vocals/mids get completely washed out by the bass and highs. 3.5/5 on sound quality.<br /><br />I think my largest complaint about these headphones is the BLEED. I recently was in my study listening to some music on about 60-75% volume level on my computer. My wife walked by to go into the bathroom to get ready, and she noted that she could hear the music I was listening to relatively clearly from across the hall over the bathroom fan. That's pretty bad. I'm used to iPhone headphone bleed being common place in the world, but from a $100 pair of headphones, I really wouldn't expect that much air to escape from so-called &#34;in ear&#34; headphones. 1/5 on isolation and feel.<br /><br />I'm going to give the headphones a little more time to see if the problem is as pronounced as I'm worried it may be.

I see some good deals one of them being bluedio . so this whole time I'm thinking about price nothing about quality. I want a sturdy pair of over the head headphones . I read the reviews and decide that $35 dollars is a good gamble on Bluetooth headphones....They were better than I expected!  Very functional and versatile (adjusting wise) . it does more than I was interested in but now I've been introduced to a whole new world of Bluetooth. Lame I know.

I also have a pair of AKG headphones that cost about $270 on sale and while those are better than these ear-buds, they are not wildly better. they have excellent sound isolating, excellent bass and range, excellent stage presence and can be worn for a couple of hours without discomfort and they stay put in your ear. In short, I doubt you can get better sound in an earbud without spending many times the price. I would go so far as to call these entry level audiophile.",2015-08-29

It randomly rebooted itself when playing DVDs, as some other people have unfortunately experienced. Sometimes it would play a whole DVD without rebooting, other times it would reboot itself several times during one DVD which became very annoying. Updating firmware didn't help. The item had this problem out of the box and while still under warranty.  I called Sony support and went through a series of trouble shooting procedures over 3 phone calls and several emails with product information and purchase receipts, Sony finally sent me a shipping label to send the item in for warranty repair. After another email request they sent me a prepaid shipping label so I didn't have to pay the shipping for the warranty repair. This whole process was a very big hassle. The 3rd party company that was performing the repair called me several times with updates (appreciated) and finally said the item to perform the repair would take nearly two months to arrive. They asked me to call Sony who offered the option of waiting for the repair part or sending me a full refund for the item. I'm currently awaiting the refund.  I'm searching again for a DVD surround system that has the same threaded speaker inputs so I don't have to re-wire my existing speakers (which I was able to keep and not return). I've decided I liked the sound quality and this system so much that despite my previous issues, I would like to purchase this unit again and cross my fingers that I get one that doesn't randomly reboot (I know, I'm taking a big risk here). The fact that I'm still actually willing to buy a replacement system after the all of the warranty hassle with Sony support is a testament itself to how much I did enjoy this system when it was working. I'll update my review and rating again after I get the refund and the new replacement system to see if it works.  UPDATE:  I received the refund check and the newly purchased unit.The unit did reboot itself twice for the first two movies but 9 movies later it hasn't done it again. If it continues I'll try swapping the speakers but otherwise it is rebooting much less than the previous unit. Updating rating from 2 to 4 stars. Am happy with the new unit and hope the rebooting stops or is minimized. It does sound better than my other two surround systems.",2015-08-29

The increased bass over the HJE350s is the deciding factor.  I guess I didn't know what I was missing, but it's very apparent listening to these and HJE350s back-to-back on several tracks. These are less than half the cost of the 350s, probably because of the build quality.  The cable on the 350s is better, too...a bit thicker and less prone to tangles.  Not sure how these will hold up over time, but the better sound wins.<br />#2 - HJE350s. As stated above, very solid build quality and better cable.  But...the missing bass and a being bit too bright on the high end frequencies puts these in 2nd place.<br />#3 - HJE120.  Not sure how these can be the best selling buds on Amazon, even at the lowest price.  Both bass and high end is completely missing. They fit OK though and would probably be OK for basic voice and video listening.

It really seemed as though this speaker is designed to turn the room itself into a giant reverberating speaker cabinet.  While listening to bands with the classic set up of bass-guitar-drums-vocals, I was really enthralled by the sound that this speaker was able to produce.<br /><br />But with Reggae, Hip-Hop, and even some Jazz, this speaker simply could not handle low bass frequencies and distorted like a beat up hoopty rolling down the street with the trunk buzzing and rattling.<br /><br />Use Reggae to test any new speaker you purchase!  Try listening to &#34;Mr. Brown&#34; by Bob Marley, or the album &#34;Return of the Super Ape&#34; by Lee Perry with this speaker and you'll end up returning it.  Even listening to &#34;Othello&#34; by the jazz outfit &#34;Chicago Underground Trio&#34; was distorted and disappointing, and that track only features a traditional acoustic bass, not the ultra low bass used in most contemporary Hippity-Hop compositions.<br /><br />I ended up returning this and purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio, which was on sale for one hundred pieces of scrilla less than this piece of ish.  The Bose speaker is way more portable, and has a much better battery life, but it is completely unacceptable if I have to pay three hundred for it, and end up avoiding listening to twenty-five percent of my music collection because of its poor low end response.<br /><br />If you're looking for a speaker you can easily pack up into a suit case and set up quickly in a hotel to listen to soothing piccolo-heavy classical music with, by all means, this is the speaker for you, but don't expect to be able to unwind with &#34;It Was a Good Day&#34; by Ice Cube with this over rated piece of equipment.

I rated these headphones “5 Stars” on Amazon because they are easily a perfect score in every category when compared to products within a $50-$80 price range.***<br /><br />Full Review:<br />I purchased these headphones after seeing the insane amount of positive reviews over a $15 pair of headphones. My headphones of choice are the studio staple Sony MDR-7506. My pair is, however, wearing out quite a bit. And before investing another $100 on a new pair, I figured I’d give this set a try. Being someone who uses headphones for audio engineering and sound mastering, my preferences are typically geared towards a “clean” or “true” sound rather than a “good” sound. In other words, I’d rather my headphones leave bad recording quality sounding bad rather than making a poor recording sound great. Because of that, I have rated these headphones on both sound “quality” and “trueness” as separate categories. I will be grading these headphones in comparison to headphones of any price range, so the below ratings will not be a reflection of comparing these headphones with comparable models at similar price.<br /><br />Sound Quality: 3 out of 5<br />For casual listening, it does not get too much better than this. The bass hits hard and these headphones can get loud without the slightest distortion. In my experience, sound quality is typically not this high until you are at least in the $60 or higher range of headphones. I won’t go so far as some other reviews have gone in comparing these to Beats Audio or Bose, but such comparisons are not completely misguided. The biggest miss for sound quality overall comes in that the headphones have a very “roomy” or “small” sound to them. Nothing ever feels live or vivid due to a limited EQ range. Where the headphones hit, they hit hard. Unfortunately, you don’t ever hear the full depth of a song with these headphones. Something is missing. Despite this, these are far superior to the sounds of most standard or high end ear buds and on par with upper-mid range ($60-$100) headsets.<br /><br />Sound Trueness: 2 out of 5<br />Without boring anyone not looking to use these for music editing I’ll simply say this: I’ve gotten far less quality with far more money. Yet, these are in no way replacing my Sony MDR-7506 for studio editing anytime soon. The sound is too bass heavy and flat. High ends are a struggle and replaced often with dull mid-tones. Mixes done exclusively with these headphones would likely have weak bass and extreme high ends through other speakers if made to sound neutral through these headphones.<br /><br />Build Quality: 2 out of 5<br />These headphones look and feel like $15 headphones. The plastic feels flimsy and cheap. They are very light, in a bad way, as well. Handling these headphones makes me very worried I will break them quite easily. Time will tell if that plays out to be true. Regardless, for $15, it is not really going to make me very upset if these do break within a year.<br /><br />Comfort: 2 out of 5<br />These headphones are a bit too small to be very comfortable on the ears long. They grip tight and stay put, which is a plus, but the cushions press against the ear causing that “warm” feeling. These headphones are not for marathon uses. I did like that they have a nice cushion on the arch on top of the head and the fact that the buds themselves are capable of pivoting is another nice feature.<br /><br />Noise Cancellation: 2 out of 5<br />This comes down to the size again. Because the headphones do not fully envelope the ear, and rather rest upon the ear, they are not capable of fully muting external noise. These headphones do a pretty decent job at tuning out the world around you however, but it is usually due more to their loudness than their actual noise elimination.<br /><br />Style & Appearance: 4 out of 5<br />Sleek, simple, matte, compact. You can’t go wrong with simple and sweet. They also come with a very nice felt case to carry in, an unexpected bonus for such an inexpensive pair of headphones. Only complaint is, oddly, the lack of branding. A little Amazon logo or something would actually tie this piece together nicely. Without any branding, you feel more like you have a pair of headphones picked up at a convenience store. This will be a positive to some, but for me the absence of branding added to the “cheap” overall feel of the headphones.<br /><br />Value: 5 out of 5<br />This is a no brainer. You won’t get within galaxies of this quality for $15 with any other pair of headphones. Bottom line, if you aren’t going to invest more than $100 in headphones, there is no sense investing in any other than Amazon’s offering here. Period.<br /><br />Overall: 3 out of 5<br />All things considered, these are $15 headphones performing at the level of $100 headphones. You can’t go wrong. Don’t expect to throw away your Bose, Sony, or Beats headphones anytime soon as some reviewers have suggested, but these headphones will give the “average Joe” a pretty compelling reason to not invest in any of the prior-mentioned if you have not already done so.pretty decent job at tuning out the world around you however, but it is usually due more to their loudness than their actual noise elimination.<br /><br />Style & Appearance: 4 out of 5<br />Sleek, simple, matte, compact.

I<br /> use a swim leash in my home pool since my pool is not very long, (the swim<br /> leash is a bungee cord that connects around your waist and to the end of<br /> the pool so you can swim in place).  So far the Diver is working fine and<br /> makes your workout more enjoyable.<br /><br /> I tested the Diver for lap swimming.  I do flip-turns and found that the<br />Diver only stayed in my ears for a few laps before coming out.  I think the<br /> ear plugs could stay in my ears if I use a swim cap to cover the ear plugs<br /> while lap swimming and doing flip turns.  That would protect the ear plugs<br /> from the fast water flow that happens when you push off the wall. I<br /> currently do not have a swim cap so it may be a while before I can test it.<br /><br /> NOTE: You do have to make sure that the ear plugs go deep into your ears<br /> otherwise water will get inside and you will not be able to hear the music.<br /><br /> Robert Townsend",2015-08-29

I've always been a fan of Panasonic stuff, and the overall quality of these is very good.  This set has never come apart or broken in the 4+ years I had them. Not a single problem.  When I went to order replacement set, I decided to try a couple other sets that were lower in price and do a comparison.  The other 2 sets were the Panny RP-TCM125 and RP-HJE120.<br /><br />I'll get the HJE120 out of the way first...easy decision as #3 out of the 3. These are apparently the bestselling earbuds here.  I'm guessing it's because of the price, because the sound quality is mediocre at best.  OK for voice or videos, but missing both bass and high end for any sort of music listening.  They block out sound about the same as the other 2 sets, which I would rate as OK.<br /><br />After listening to the 3 sets back-to-back on several different tracks, I've come to the conclusion that these HJE350's definitely lack bass, especially as compared to the TCM125's.  Also, these are just a wee bit too bright, I think.  Would describe it as &#34;fatiguing&#34; after listening for a longer period of time.  I guess I did not notice the lack of bass in the prior 4 years of ownership.  The HJE350s do have the best construction of the 3 I tested and the cable is bit thicker, so tangles less. Plus these have the little clip thing and you can put it behind your head so they are more secure and you don't get as much cable noise physically transmitted to the earbuds.<br /><br />Of these 3, I think I prefer the sound of the TCM125s.  Absolutely have stronger bass, and maybe better midrange (vocals), too.  These are just missing a bit at the high end...but only a bit.  These have a microphone, which doesn't really matter to me, just mentioning it. These buds are shaped the same as the HJE350s, which is a good thing as they fit me well. Unfortunately, the cable on these is cheap and tangles easily.  I'm going to use these and keep theHJE350s as a backup pair.",2015-08-29

Upon placing these velvet pads and listening to some music, I can honestly say they physically feel like a different pair of headphones! They're so much more comfortable now, and are much less sweat-inducing than the stock plastic pads. There's a fair bit more give to these pads than the stock ones too; you'll feel a very noticeable change in pressure. And finally, I do hear some of the acoustic changes mentioned by some other reviewers here as well; they definitely do open the soundstage a bit more. I suppose this would make sense since sound waves penetrate felt and foam more easily than the much firmer plastic surface of the old pads. I would definitely recommend purchasing these if you want to upgrade the feel and characteristics of your K240s.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Softer than stock pads<br />+ Opens soundstage further<br />+ Not at all sweat-inducing<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None came to mind during my testing",2015-08-29

There are also visualizers available for iTunes that do the same thing. The promise that the JTP light programs &#34;synch with your music&#34; led me to expect that at the very least, the lights would sync in time with the basslines played through the JTP, or that at best, music played through the JTP would cause the lights to behave differently depending on rhythm and intensity, etc. But the light programs are &#34;static&#34; in the sense that once a given program has been activated, it doesn't change if there is silence, fast thumping rhythms and beats (e.g., Die Antwoord music), ambient sounds (e.g., Brian Eno's Music for Airports), peaceful nature sounds (e.g., recordings by the late, great Dan Gibson), or different kinds of classical music. Of course the brain can be tricked into thinking that lights are moving in sync with music, especially if one is in some kind of Dionysian trance, but that's not the same as the JTP actually being designed and programmed to sync the lights with the music. Thus, the JTP only gives you a light show in a weak sense of the term.<br /><br />The audio quality of this Bluetooth speaker is good, overall. The bass is okay. Being old school as far as speakers are concerned - meaning that if I want big sound and big bass I know I must have big speakers and probably a separate subwoofer - I tend to be incredulous when anyone uses adjectives like &#34;booming,&#34; &#34;thumping,&#34; and &#34;driving&#34; to describe the bass produced by itsy bitsy Bluetooth speakers like the JTP. But given its size and for a small portable wireless speaker the bass isn't bad. The physical design of the JTP makes it attractive and it seems pretty rugged, and the packaging design and construction is outstanding in a way that makes for an eminently gift worthy presentation (and presumably adds to the cost). The JTP can be used on its side but it's clearly designed to be used in a vertical position.<br /><br />Bluetooth connectivity worked flawlessly for me with different devices, and the Bluetooth range of the JTP I received is excellent. The JTP includes voice prompts in different languages that tell you when the speaker is powered on and has been successfully paired, etc. The language can be changed (by means of in included pin, though a paperclip would do) and the voice prompts can also be turned off. The electronics of this device make it pretty user-friendly.<br /><br />The JTP comes pre-charged. Like so many rechargeable devices, the JTP is designed in such a way that its rechargeable lithium ion battery is not user replaceable. But the JTP can be powered via USB connected to a computer or USB wall wart, so it will still be usable as a wired speaker when the rechargeable battery finally stops holding a charge.<br /><br />The JTP will certainly make a great first impression if given to someone as a gift (and the fact that it comes pre-charged means that gift recipients will be able to start using it immediately).

The sound that is transmitted is one of the clearest i have heard this far. Despite the first hand look at this, it may seem that the speaker does not have any bass. However I have found that this is not true. It will play bass but it will be slightly dampened. I found that placing the speaker on top of a large, hollow container helps to amplify the bass output from this speaker. Connection is relatively speedy once the device has been configured. Now for the review most people will here which is the 4 star portion.<br /><br />4 stars based on the fact that this speaker may not be the best Bluetooth speaker out there.<br />Because of the fact this Bluetooth speaker is still just one speaker, there is no other outputs between the treble and the bass. Meaning when it all goes through the speaker at once. This might sound a bit stupid but from my experience, the speaker will start to muffle the sound when it tries to play both bass and treble simultaneously. It also doesn't have that strong of bass.

Loudest BT Speaker I have ever used","- Quality made, definitely not a cheapo speaker, Water resistant and has built-in microphone for phone calls<br /><br />- Very loud, louder than Anker’s 20 watt Bluetooth speaker and has more bass, but is heavier<br />- I turned it all the way up and could hear it outside of my house<br />- Quality metal mesh, front and back<br />- It is a lot heavier though with the 3 inch subwoofer, but has nice bass that will rumble your desk<br />- 5V/1A input it takes a several hours to charge, I just left it charging overnight to be safe<br />- NFC feature can be nice as well<br /><br />- Incredible battery life, more than expected, makes a weird noise before dying completely<br />Ran the speaker at mid volume from 3:30 PM to 11:30 PM (8 Hours), then I turned it off and<br />turned it back on around 12:45 PM and ran it until 4:48 PM (an additional 4 hours)<br /><br />-When I saw the stated battery life at 8 hours I was amazed that this lasted over 12 hours! Without recharging, keep in mind the volume was about midway...<br /><br />I assume it would last the 8 hours or less if you have the volume set to high, since the subwoofer can cause more drain<br /><br />All and all excellent Bluetooth speaker, keep in mind the weight of this thing is pretty hefty and the size is just a little bigger than others I have tested… See pictures for comparisons",2015-08-29

The speaker is well built, and feels very solid. It's not as heavy as you might expect, but it doesn't vibrate or rattle at all. Room placement is very important for this thing though. If you aren't getting the bass you think you should, try moving it to a few different locations in the room.<br /><br />For home theater use: Awesome. This thing rocks for movie watching. It's powerful enough to keep up with any loud action movie, and the bass rumble under explosions is amazing. I've an audiophile friend that runs a Martin Logan Descent i, and he was &#34;disgusted&#34; at how good this sounds watching movies considering the price.<br /><br />For music use: Decent. Depending on the style of music you are listening to, the Bic is pretty good for music, but not phenomenal. Oddly if you are listening to something that can *really* reach low, like EDM or rap, the Bic can be a little light on the extreme low end. Jazz, orchestral, and light rock all sounds great.

The advantage it does have is that it's only $7.  And if you're expecting more than $7 worth of music playing out of this you're fooling yourself.  I will say that it does have its uses and if you work around a few of the problems with it it is a great little player.<br />For starters I didn't use the card reader.  I tried and it didn't work for me right off, so I just used the one I already had.  If I messed with it more I could have probably gotten it to work.  I didn't use the earplugs either since they felt cheap and I already had some that I liked.<br />That being said, the usb charger cable worked fine using an iphone wall charger that I already had (it doesn't come with its own wall charger, just the usb to mini-usb cable).  It is definitely awkward to charge.  I managed to get it to charge by leaving the switch in the on position.  Plugging it into the wall charger with the cable and then flipping the switch to the off position.  The orange light flashes while it charges and the next morning the orange light was solid indicating it was fully charged.  The charge lasts for about 4 hours I think is the most I've ever gotten out of it, and I noticed it takes just about that long to fully charge it.<br />It does not have a shuffle feature.  From what I noticed it just plays the songs in the order in which they were added to the card.  Also note, you have to buy your own micro SD card to use with it, it does not have its own memory or come with its own card.  I formatted a card to FAT32 and uploaded just fine.  After I realized the order it plays the song I changed my approach.<br />Round 2 I downloaded a program called &#34;Random Copy&#34; that you can download for free.  I played around with it for a while and basically found out how to get it to upload songs from my computer to the mp3 player in a random order.  This basically gave it the effect of playing in shuffle mode.  With 8GB of music playing random songs in a fixed order, it was hard to tell it wasn't in shuffle mode.<br />Some annoying things with it are that it won't remember the volume setting (always starts roughly medium volume).  There is some static at lower volumes and with the headphones I have (in ear) I had to play it at the lowest settings.  So the static was annoying.  It saves what song you were on last, but not where in the song you were.  So, I wouldn't recommend this for audio books.<br />For me, this works great for what I needed it for.  I have it hooked up to an FM transmitter to play on my work van stereo.  It's always plugged into power so the battery life doesn't matter to me, nor how long it takes to charge.  I drive a lot, so 8 GB of music was all that I needed.  I've probably driven several hours with it playing and can't really tell that it's not shuffling with how I have it set up.<br />Like I said in the beginning.  If you want all the bells and whistles of a ipod shuffle, you'll want to pay more money and get one.  Otherwise, if you're willing to work a little extra to get this to do what you want, $7 is well worth it.",2015-08-28

Finally I tried using a power adapter/surge protector. Nope. Still did the exact same thing. I tried to return my item only to be told it was 2 days outside THEIR return window of 30 days.

The resonance decreased tremendously.  It's still there but much less severe.  I'm still tempted to return it but then I remember my other radio, having to move the antenna to try and tune in the stations that the Model One receives effortlessly.

Not sure if I was spoiled coming from my current setup of speakers with a dedicated DAC (Oppo HA-1) with my Adam Audio ARTist 5 speakers. I also have been tested speakers for a new computer build using a MATRIX Mini-i Pro DAC started with Genelec 8020C Active Two-Way 4&quot; Studio Monitor, and then the Kef's X300A by them self, along with some Genelec 8020C Active Two-Way 4&quot; Studio Monitors. And I must say the KEF's sounded the worst out of all speakers. I really wanted to like them I think they look the best out of the bunch, but other then the large size like my Adam's ARTist 5 speakers. They come off very bright with no mid-range and a boomy bass that's trying to hard. Now I watched many YouTube video's on the Kef's X300A and watching the video I noticed the FRONT midrange/woofer section move's allot to all types of music in the review's, but for some reason mine very rarely moved which made the the speakers come across very bright sounding. So I thought maybe I am have a driver issue so I used my new laptop no audio drivers on it same issue, I even used my friends computer to try one last time same problem. I decided to let the speakers break in for a week with the same outcome. So I decided to send them back and went with the Genelec 8020C Active Two-Way 4&quot; Studio Monitors. They come in half the size of the Kef's X300A and put out 10 times the clear neutral sound. And yes they were $300 more but worth every penny, along with my Adam speakers. I also sent back the Senal speakers which are copy's from the Genelecs at half the price but had too much distortion.<br />I am not done with KEF I will be building a living room listening setup and plan on trying the Kef LS50's which seem very popular I just hope I do not have the same bad luck like I did with the X300A speakers.",2015-08-28

I love having an extension cord and multiple outlet jack with me since most hotel rooms already have lamps and clocks etc plugged into their outlets. With the short cord on this one, however, it hangs behind the nighstand awkwardly. The cord is so short that is doesn't even reach the floor all the way so it just kind of dangles there.

In the pool I swim every stroke with flip-turns.  The ear buds stay in.<br />Previous to these Swimbuds I had the Waterfi's that came with the iPod Shuffle I use.<br />- In comparison to the Waterfi Shortcord headphones these headphones are superior for 1 main reason: the earpieces do not come off when removing the bud.  With the Waterfi's, after 1 month of use, the ear pieces stuck in my ear no matter how carefully I tried to remove them, requiring tweezers to remove (not fun at the gym).<br />- The one benefit of the Waterfi is the cord is of perfect length.  The Swimbuds are a little long.  You need to hook them into your goggles so they don't catch on your neck when you rotate to breathe.  So, w/o goggles they would be a problem.<br /><br />One big ouch: after purchasing the headphones in January, this week (August 28th), one of the buds died.<br />If these were $10 headphones, I wouldn't mind, but a $40 pair should last at least a year.<br /><br />Modified Review:<br />After posting this review the seller contacted me.  Even though the warranty had expired, and I completed some minor troubleshooting, the seller is mailing me a replacement set of earphones, so I'm giving them 4 stars for great customer service.  The price is still quite high ($40) which is why I don't provide the 5th star, but as I said they are the best I've used.<br /><br />3rd Review:<br />The replacement pair died after a few 4 months. For $40, they should warranty for at least 2 years.",2015-08-28

Recently my beloved Sony MDREX 58V headphones took a turn for the worse. Unfortunately, Sony doesn't make them anymore so everyone who has them are charging twice as much as I got them before so I had to look for an alternative.<br /><br />I ended up with a pair of Senty headphones. They sound awful compared to the Sony's I had so I immediately ordered these. I should've went with these in the first place because they sound incredible, if not better than the 58's and these also have a mic which I was not expecting.<br /><br />To be honest, I wouldn't have bought these if I knew it had a mic because every headset I've bought with a mic hasn't sounded as good as the headphones I've got without a mic. To my surprise that isn't the case AT ALL with these and these might actually be the best sounding headphones I've ever owned.<br /><br />Much like the Sony 58's I had before, these sound almost perfect. The sound they produce is so well balanced. The right amount of everything, treble, mids, and bass.<br /><br />A lot of people like headphones with exaggerated bass but I can't stand it. I also don't like the more boomy bass as well. These Sony's have the more desireable deep bass. They sound a lot like a Bose speaker system would. Deep bass, crystal clear treble, and well projected mid's.'<br /><br />They also fit perfectly which is crucial. With any pair of in ear headphones, the rubber needs to create a perfect seal to sound right. Other headphones you need to wiggle around to hit the sweet spot and can be dislodged from that sweet spot just by walking. These headphones fit perfectly right when you put them in and stay that way. I don't think there's any way they could fall out unless you yank them out yourself<br /><br />Also, seeing that they have the same design as my previous Sony's, I can assume the sound doesn't degrade over time like most other in ear headphones do. The problem with other headphones is they often get some waxy build up on the tip of them. The problem is it's very hard to clean because if you get any moisture at all inside of headphones like this, there goes all your treble. Your headphones won't be able to produce treble the same way if even a little bit of moisture gets inside them. Its happened a few times with the ultra popular $7 Panasonics I've tried and pretty much every other headphones I've tried other than Sony's. Even just wearing some headphones too much during humid weather or during a rain storm can ruin the treble of them and they'll sound totally different over time to the day you bought them.<br /><br />That is somehow not the case with these sony's. Not only are the rubber ear pieces designed differently but the tips themselves are as well and it somehow does the trick and protects these things to make sure they'll sound good as new for a very long time. That was the case with my last Sony's and I had those for almost 2 years which is forever for me. Most headphones only last me a few months other than Sony's.",2015-08-28

US,18649782,R2RPW54GJ37Q2K,B004GAKIKW,24568482,C Crane Co CCRadio-EP AM FM Analog Radio (CEP),Electronics,3,9,9,N,Y,Needs Some Refinement,"Were the designers of the CCRadio-EP influenced by the later GE Superadios?  If they were, from the standpoint of features, they certainly took things to the next level.  For example, instead of simple screw terminals for attachment of external antennas, the EP has spring clips for an AM antenna, an F-connector for an FM antenna and an internal/external antenna switch.  In order to help capture distant AM signals, the EP also includes C. Crane's exclusive Twin-Coil Ferrite antenna.<br /><br />Additional features that weren't part of the later Superadios include a button for lighting the dial, an input that allows personal music devices to be played through the unit and FM stereo listening capability via the headphone jack.<br /><br />Like the Superadios, the EP utilizes a wide band/narrow band switch for AM along with bass and treble controls.  The wide band mode offers a wider frequency response which works well for listening to strong daytime signals.  The narrow band mode works well for post-sunset listening when adjacent station interference is an issue.<br /><br />While I don't expect a radio with analog tuning to have pinpoint dial accuracy, mine was off by about 20 kHz on the AM dial.  This problem seemed to be consistent regardless of what end of the dial I was on.  It appeared to me that if the frequency window had been moved to the right a bit, it would have been perfect .  I didn't check to see how the dial pointer/markings lined up with FM stations.<br /><br />If you like a radio where the tuning mechanism moves easily, this is your radio.  I felt it moved too easily.  In combination with the annoying amount of 'play' in the mechanism, it made the radio feel cheap.<br /><br />Overall, the radio looks nice and the handle flipped up into its carrying position with a satisfying click.<br /><br />My EP radio provided excellent sound when using the included AC to DC adapter but was inoperable with a fresh set of batteries.  Even the lighted dial wouldn't workwhen utilizing battery power.  The lack of battery functionality, the dial accuracy issue and the play in the tuning mechanism caused me to return the radio but I won't rule out the possibility of trying this product again in the future.<br /><br />While this purchase experience was a disappointment, I still believe in what C. Crane is doing.  In fact, I wish they would implement many of the features and things they've learned from the EP, the Gozo and their 2E model to market a wood cabinet replacement for the numerous table radios of the past like the Sony ICF-9740W.  I realize that Sangean has the WR-2 and WR-11, Tivoli has their Model One and Crosley has their Solo and Ranchero models.  Those radios have their place but I can't help but think there's a market for something a bit larger that could be manufactured closer to true, low distortion, hi-fi specifications.  Designing it to allow for stereo functionality via an optional matching speaker would be interesting as well.  I feel this product would fill the niche that currently exists between the radios I've already mentioned and the tube-based offerings from Tesslor.",2015-08-28

I was, however, able to fix this by configuring VLANs and &#34;IGMP snooping&#34; on my network switches ([[ASIN:B00GG1ACX2 NETGEAR ProSAFE JGS516PE 16-Port Gigabit Rackmount PoE Plus Switch with 8 PoE Ports 85w (JGS516PE-100NAS)]] and [[ASIN:B00J8NAWZ8 NETGEAR ProSAFE GS105PE 5-Port PoE-Powered (PD) Gigabit Plus Switch with PoE Pass-Through (GS105PE-10000S)]]). 1.) First log into your switch and setup the vlans: 2.) Enable port based VLAN (In my netgear switches it is under &#34;advanced&#34; in the vlan tab). 3.) Remove the port/s connected to the HDMI receiver/sender from vlan1. 4.) Create a new VLAN (I used VLAN2) and add the port connected to the HDMI receiver/sender and the uplink port (or port connected to the other HDMI receiver/sender). 5.) Enable IGMP snooping on VLAN1. 6.) Do the same as above for the other switch on your network (if you have one).  Thats fixed it for me.  Now I have a super fast wired/wireless network again and HDMI to my TV over TCP/IP.",2015-08-28

I am an avid athlete and exercise six days a week. I bought these headphones to wear during runs and gym workouts. They are great, lightweight and stay put on your ears and head. The bonus to these was the mesh headphone covers that you can remove and wash when they get soaked with sweat. Well, the first time I washed them and tried to put them back on, both pads tore. Still wearable but I felt I wanted to replace them. I wrote the company and got an email back asking for all my info, a copy of the sales receipt, etc. I emailed back and said I simply wanted to purchase replacement pads. They then emailed me back for my info to &#34;put me on a list with other customers. When I responded saying again that I simply wanted to purchase some replacements, they responded by saying that I would be put on a list and when they were available, I would be notified. Repeatedly I asked for a telephone number for customer service but was never given one. I am now stuck with these ripped pads and have no idea when or if I will get a response. Be wary of companies that do not have customer service phone contacts. Such a drag because, as I said, really solid headphones.",2015-08-28

The instructions are not great, so it takes some experimentation. The center button is only used to adjust volume. The menu button is used to select when pressed normally.

Every few months it never fails that he comes home from school complaining that his headphones no longer work. Most of the time is the issue was from the speaker wires inside the ear piece detaching most likely from bumping around in his backpack.<br /><br />Since he has started school we have not had to deal with him coming home with broken headphones nor have we had to deal with his complaints of them being hard to hear out of as that was another issue with other lower cost headphones.<br /><br />These headphones have a solid sound to them. You could never compare them to say Beats Audio but for the money you are going to get a quality pair of headphones that are very durable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Low cost<br />Good quality sound<br />Fast Shipping<br />Excellent brand<br />Fits my 8 year old very comfortably<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not sound proof (was not an issue for our needs)",2015-08-28

I purchased the [[ASIN:B00LAZ6RTW Avantree APTX LOW LATENCY bluetooth transmitter and reciever 2-in-1 switchable adapter for wireless watch tv without LIP SYNC DELAY - Saturn Pro]] so I could connect it to my TV and have no problems. To test it further I had the sound playing through the TV and the headphones at the same time. If you stare incredibly intently at the TV you might convince yourself there is some millisecond delay (not enough to be annoying), but otherwise it is completely imperceptible. Also, though it says on Amazon that the headphones are only bluetooth 2.0, that is not correct.

So you can imagine my frustration in realizing this too late, but even if I had 16&#34; spacing, I would be only able to hang it directly between wherever the studs are located. Unlike another wall bracket I bought, it does not have extending/ wider adaptors that allows it to fit on wider stud spacing and let's you place the TV in the exact place you want. Luckily there's an easy fix- just got a 4 1/2 ft piece of strong plywood that spans all the studs, cut the height so it hid behind my tv, routed the edges, painted it to match the wall, anchored the wood to the wall and attached the bracket to that. Since then it works fine and holds up my 50&#34; screen nicely.",2015-08-28

Sound was reasonable for what it was, seemed somewhat rugged.  However, initial warning signs were that it seemed flaky concerning charging, and the &#34;instructions&#34; are effectively non-existent.  After using for maybe a total of 10 hours, it became impossible to charge it.  Support was pretty much useless.  The warranty - given the price of the item itself - is worthless.<br /><br />Pyle support (after a bunch of attempts to reach them) finally said yes, it seems defective.  So, even though I had not owned it long (but longer than 30 days, so beyond the Amazon return window) they said for me to pay to ship it someplace in NY along with a description of the issue.  They issue no RMA number nor do they &#34;track&#34; the incident.  Furthermore, they also require  &#34;you will also need to include a prepaid shipping label or a $10 money order to cover the return shipping&#34; (quote from their response).  So, for a $39 item that quickly failed, you end up paying $20 in shipping to have it &#34;repaired&#34;.<br /><br />Finally, even though I had followed their process to &#34;extend the warranty (which is useless but I didn't know it at the time) by writing a review somewhere, and filling out data on their site, they seem to have no visibility of their own systems, resulting in my getting spammed by that &#34;offer&#34; time after time - for many months after I had already done what they asked.<br /><br />Bottom line is that Pyle seems to no longer be the company that they used to be.  I will not consider any Pyle products in the future.  The only reason I gave this 2 stars rather than 1 is because it least temporarily it worked.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.",2015-08-28

Even though my 116 is long out of warranty he has offered to replace it. No one could ask for better customer service than that.<br /><br />After hearing from the vendor I have reverted this to the  five star rating  that I wanted to give it originally,  though with a caveat about the cables. The vendor says that the cables are for light duty, and that the device is intended for desktop use. I have to agree. Strapping it to the fork arm of a telescope mount while not rough service could be more than the designers intended. It is a fine product for the intended use. I like the driver support and the fact that there was no problem when I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. The XP install also works fine. I only am speaking about the drivers. I do not use the included software.<br /><br />Below is part of the original review, describing the problem, the cause of the failure and a way to fix it. One of the two conductors from the yellow (video) jack broke inside of the plastic sheathing on the RCA plug. The expedient repair was to cut off the RCA plug and splice in a new one of a similar style. Then to add some bending resistance I cut a length of garden irrigation tubing, slit it length wise, tucked in the cable and wrapped the full length electrical tape. So far it works. The grabber is back in place and works normally.<br /><br />Everything I said originaly including the option to look at less expensive alternatives, still goes. That said the EZCAP 116 is a good choice for the intended purpose and frees you crap shoot of finding drivers on the net.<br /><br />Review-- The EZCAP 116 uses an eMPIA 2861 chipset, as good as any made, and the vendor has good email/forum support. When my original purchase developed an intermittent signal, they promptly sent me another one. The EZCAP 116 is at least the equal of the Dazzle that I once had and the support is much better. The 116 drivers work in Windows XP, Vista, Seven and 10. The image quality is as good as any I have seen.<br /><br />Why then do I not give it 5 stars and why should you consider buying some other frame grabber. The answer is that the 116 and many other frame grabber-USB dongles use a very light wire gauge to connect the various jacks to the dongle and these wires can and do break. In this case creating first an intermittent signal loss and then total loss.<br /><br />This dongle is strapped to one arm of a telescope mount and when the scope barrel is elevated or depressed the coax cable from the camera moves the video jack side to side a little. Over time this small movement was enough to break one of the conductors from the jack to the dongle.<br /><br />Rather than buy another EZCAP116 my suggestion is to to look for a lower price dongle that uses the eMPIA chipset or perhaps an STK chipset. You may have to do a bit of searching to find out what chipset is in any product, though reviewers often post that information. Once connected to a PC, Device Manager will show in the device name or in the driver info the chipset.<br /><br />The fragile cable is the only defect in the product however for me it is a critical defect. I willingly purchased it at a higher price than other dongles for claims of quality and support and the initial support was good.<br /><br />In summary, the EZCAP.TV116, uses an eMPIA chipset, performs well in Windows XP through Windows 10. It is not rugged, the very light guage. It will not outperform dongles with the same chipset sold at lower cost by other vendors. Remember though that if you buy from EBay or Alibaba it is very much a buyer beware purchase, and of course slower delivery by China mail.as any I have seen.

I'm no sound expert but as a daily user of consumer headphone I'll recommend it to all those who wants a good quality in terms of build and sound.,2015-08-28

I did replace the speaker wire with a better quality as the ones that came with it were very thin. I was a little disappointed in Onkyo to even supply the cheap wire with a quality system.  Love the surround sound and can't wait to watch a dolby Atmos movie.  2/3/17 Update At about the 10th month of owning this system, it went into 'protection mode'.   I took it to an authorized Onkyo repair shop, which was 110 miles OW from me and after 3 weeks, they returned it to me, without having done anything as they could not duplicate the problem.  When I got it home, it worked, only to shut off again after a month or so.  Of course by then it was out of warranty.  The system just sat there, until I decided to try it again and it worked again.  Of course it was only for a short period of time before it went into 'protection mode' again. I checked all the speaker wires, unplug, plugged it back in to no avail.   I contacted Onkyo customer support service to see if there was anything else I needed to do.   Their answer:  &#34;The receiver is in protection mode. Since the receiver is out of warranty your best option would be to opt for our trade in program.&#34;   Needless to say this is a totally unacceptable answer and I have to believe all the reviews about the Onkyo customer service being below par.  Don't buy an Onkyo unless you know how to work on electronics.  As a reviewer said:  I now have a $700 paperweight.   Very disappointing.",2015-08-28

Speakers don't really impress me that often. That said, this little thing packs a nice punch of sound. Far too often will I use my computer speakers for some jams with bass and not hear anything where the bass hits. At the same time, I can't carry my stereo with me. If the music you love has a lot of bass and range, you know what I'm talking about. No more fuzzies and that cheap garbage mono sound.<br /><br />The Sound<br />This is the most important thing for me. The fact that I can hear the bass and the various elements clearly, tells me this thing is pretty impressive. I was waiting for some distortion when it's put on blast but the blast was just dope vibes. Let's face it, bluetooth has a long way to go still, especially with pairing, but this thing paired quick with my iPhone and we were soundcloud jamming in a swift. (I'm all about that bass)<br />I would definitely recommend this for general listening and pop/rock music but especially for my bass and hip hop heads out there who need to spontaneously jam out on the spot! I also listened to a 320kbps re-mastered version of The Flower Duet (Lakm&eacute;)&#34; by L&eacute;o Delibes and it really gave a clear sound.<br /><br />The Feels and Portability<br />As you can see in my picture, this device is a little longer than a basic pen, but still weighs under a pound.<br />There are rubberized blue plastic ridges around the entire thing that gives it a nice bounce cushion (shockproof). It gives it a good grip.<br />It doesn't feel like cheap plastic or the left overs plastics of a model airplane.<br />I also like the hexagonal screws they used. There's a style element to that.<br />There's also a nice loop in the frame for a keychain or a strap/lanyard (included in the box). You can hook that onto your backpack and be the life of a party by just walking in. Lastly, I like that the aux in and power have a lid/cap on it to keep sand, dirt, dust out of there. Keeps the contacts clean for a good connection.<br /><br />Waterproof<br />Honestly, I have not tried dumping water on this for obvious reasons. I will just believe them and avoid water at all costs. However, the freedom to not hesitate while at a punchbowl in the mountains is also important. I'll be taking this to the beach a lot and feeling confident about it.<br />Singing in the rain? Yes with this you can.<br /><br />Battery Life<br />This is probably the 2nd most important thing for me. Look if you're gonna have a dance party that's only gonna last for 10 minutes, is it even worth having? Okay it is but you get the idea. This thing comes with a 1800mAh rechargeable built-in battery. I've been jamming for 3 hours straight and it's still going strong. I would have liked to have a battery indicator of some kind but with a battery that plays through an afternoon off of one charge, I'm not really itching for it. I'll be jamming it out through the weekend and see how long this guy goes.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />The box also contains a USB cable for charging, and a short 1/8th in audio cable for your phones and laptops. You can use your laptop to charge it or just plug it in next to your cell phone or even a battery bank. If you don't have the budget for Bose or Sonos, fear not, this thing will satisfy your craving for high quality sound at a very affordable price.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest & unbiased review and to help give meaningful feedback for future products.to keep sand, dirt, dust out of there.

I couldn't find another one that had all the features this one does: volume control, track forward/back, micro SD card ability, microphone, auxiliary jack and cable, wall plug and USB cable for charging, appealing design. Speaker definitely has great full sound for its size. Impressive. The cables it comes with are shorter than I'd like, but I have much longer cables I can use instead (or you could easily buy another longer cable for very little money) so that's not a big deal to me. The biggest issue I ran into is that the speaker will not play when fully charged and still plugged in. It will play when plugged in while it's still charging, but once fully charged, nothing. I'm forced to unplug it at that point to be able to use it (hence I docked a star on the rating). Which stinks because ideally I just wanted to keep this little speaker always plugged in so I didn't have to think about when it needed to be charged. Maybe the one I got is defective in that regard, I don't know. I may try ordering another one and see if that one works the same way, but I suspect it will. I love this little speaker otherwise so that particular drawback is a bummer.",2015-08-28
