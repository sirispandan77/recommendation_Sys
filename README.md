# recommendation_Sys
product recommedation using hybrid models

use the command : streamlit run filepath+filename to run the file.

There are basically 3 subparts:
- data visualization and word cloud generation 
- product recommendation using collaborative filtering
- product recommendation suing context based filtering

Due to lack of sufficient data, both the models are made seperately.
